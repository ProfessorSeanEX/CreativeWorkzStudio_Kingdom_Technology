> [!NOTE]
>
> ### **System Orientation: Understanding the Framework**
>
> This planning system serves **sustainable iterative development** through weekly rhythms aligned with resource allocation cycles. It mirrors the temporal organization of `data/knowledge-base/timeline/` (retrospective history) by creating prospective planning architecture:
>
> | **System Component** | **Purpose** | **Time Investment** | **Frequency** |
> |:---------------------|:------------|:--------------------|:--------------|
> | **Weekly Planning** | Define goals, align with vision | 1-2 hours | Every Friday 11 AM |
> | **Daily Execution** | Work on defined goals with focus | Variable (sustainable) | Monday-Thursday |
> | **Weekly Review** | Assess completion, document learnings | 1 hour | Thursday evening / Friday morning |
> | **Monthly Reflection** | Synthesize weekly patterns | 30 minutes | Month-end |
> | **Quarterly Assessment** | Evaluate iteration progress | 1-2 hours | Quarter-end |
>
> **💡 Key Insight**: This framework embodies Kingdom Technology principles:
>
> - ✓ **Sustainable stewardship** — *"Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom"* (Psalm 90:12)
> - ✓ **Covenant partnership** — Planning is collaborative, not hierarchical
> - ✓ **Game dev iterative thinking** — Impact-focused, depth AND breadth, flexibility over rigidity

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> ### **Temporal Symmetry Architecture**
>
> This system creates **mirror structure** with the historical timeline:
>
> ```
> data/knowledge-base/timeline/          documentation/planning/
> ├── Q4_2024_Oct-Dec/            ←→    ├── Q4_2025_Oct-Dec/
> │   ├── Oct_2024/                     │   ├── Oct_2025/
> │   │   └── [Projects]/               │   │   └── Week_1_Oct_09-15/

> │   └── Dec_2024/                     │   └── Dec_2025/
>
> RETROSPECTIVE (what happened)         PROSPECTIVE (what we plan)
> ```
>
> **Why This Matters:**
> - **Planning** = Intentions documented before execution
> - **Timeline** = Results documented after execution
> - **Comparison** = Learning loop (planned vs. actual)
> - **Alignment** = Same organizational DNA throughout project

### **Quarter / Month / Week Hierarchy**

The planning system uses a three-level temporal hierarchy mirroring `data/knowledge-base/timeline/`:

```
documentation/planning/
├── Q[N]_YYYY_Mon-Mon/           # Quarter (e.g., Q4_2025_Oct-Dec)
│   ├── Mon_YYYY/                # Month (e.g., Oct_2025)
│   │   ├── Week_N_Mon_DD-DD/   # Week (e.g., Week_1_Oct_09-15)
│   │   │   ├── weekly-plan.md  # Week's goals and focus
│   │   │   ├── daily-notes/    # Optional progress tracking
│   │   │   └── review.md       # End-of-week retrospective
│   │   ├── Week_N_Mon_DD-DD/
│   │   └── README.md           # Month overview
│   ├── Mon_YYYY/
│   └── README.md               # Quarter overview
└── README.md                   # This file
```

**Rationale:**
- **Quarters** → Business cycles, iteration phases
- **Months** → Milestone boundaries
- **Weeks** → Atomic planning units (Claude Code reset cycle)

---

### **Naming Conventions**

<div align="center">

| **Level** | **Format** | **Example** | **Purpose** |
|:----------|:-----------|:------------|:------------|
| **Quarter** | `Q[N]_YYYY_Mon-Mon` | `Q4_2025_Oct-Dec` | Business alignment |
| **Month** | `Mon_YYYY` | `Oct_2025` | Temporal grouping |
| **Week** | `Week_N_Mon_DD-DD` | `Week_1_Oct_09-15` | Planning atom |

</div>

---

### **Content Organization Patterns**

**Each week folder contains:**
1. `weekly-plan.md` — Goals, vision alignment, success criteria
2. `review.md` — Completion assessment, learnings, carry-forward
3. `daily-notes/` (optional) — Day-by-day progress if helpful

**Each month folder contains:**
- `README.md` — Month summary synthesizing weekly patterns

**Each quarter folder contains:**
- `README.md` — Quarter context, iteration alignment, milestones

---

<div align="center">

## **SECTION II: WEEKLY PLANNING CYCLE**

*The Operational Rhythm: Plan → Execute → Review → Iterate*

</div>

---

### **Friday 11 AM - Week Reset & Planning (1-2 hours)**

**Why Friday 11 AM?** Claude Code weekly limit resets, creating natural boundary.

**1. Review Last Week** *(skip for first week)*
- What did we accomplish?
- What did we learn?
- What carries forward?
- Reference: Last week's `review.md`

**2. Check Vision Alignment**
- **Iteration Context**: Where in Iteration 5?
- **Company Goals**: What does CreativeWorkzStudio need?
- **Nova Dawn Vision**: Advancing CPI-SI framework, knowledge base, ecosystem

**3. Define This Week's Goals** (3-5 objectives)
- Clear category (Foundation, Feature, Polish, Learning, Integration)
- Specific deliverable (not vague "work on X")
- Success criteria (how we know it's done)
- Estimated effort (learning capacity)

**4. Document the Plan**
- Create: `planning/Q4_YYYY.../Week_N.../weekly-plan.md`
- Use template (see Section IV)
- Commit: `git commit -m "plan: Week N goals - [summary]"`

---

### **Monday-Thursday - Execution Phase**

**Focus:**
- Reference weekly plan for direction
- Work on defined goals intentionally
- Minimize context-switching

**Flexibility:**
- Plans serve us, we don't serve plans
- Adjust if the Lord leads differently
- Modify if blockers emerge

> *"In their hearts humans plan their course, but the LORD establishes their steps"* (Proverbs 16:9)

**Progress Tracking:**
- Use todos for task-level work
- Optional: Create `daily-notes/` for insights
- Not required: Only if helpful

---

### **Thursday Evening / Friday Morning - Review (1 hour)**

**Before planning next week, review current week.**

**1. Assess Completion**
- Which goals completed?
- Which didn't finish? Why?
- Quantitative: Goals completed / planned (optional)
- Qualitative: Did we move forward meaningfully?

**2. Document Learnings**
- What worked well?
- What would we do differently?
- What surprised us?
- Categories: Technical, Process, Partnership, Kingdom Technology

**3. Create Review Artifact**
- Create: `review.md` in week folder
- Use template (see Section IV)
- Commit: `git commit -m "review: Week N retrospective"`

**4. Prepare Carry-Forward Items**
- Incomplete goals still relevant
- New insights suggesting new goals
- Blockers needing address

---

<div align="center">

## **SECTION III: GOAL FRAMEWORK**

*Categories, Standards, and Capacity Planning*

</div>

---

### **Goal Categories (Game Dev Framework)**

**Foundation** — Core infrastructure, must-haves
- Examples: Documentation systems, build environment, knowledge base organization
- Priority: High (enables all other work)

**Feature** — New capabilities, functionality
- Examples: Code implementation, algorithm development, integration work
- Priority: Variable (depends on iteration phase)

**Polish** — Refinement, quality improvement
- Examples: Documentation alignment, test coverage, code review
- Priority: Medium (important but not blocking)

**Learning** — Research, exploration, experimentation
- Examples: Tool evaluation, methodology testing, cognitive science study
- Priority: Variable (invest in future capability)

**Integration** — Connecting pieces, ecosystem work
- Examples: Repository coordination, system alignment, cross-methodology synthesis
- Priority: Medium-High (creates coherence)

---

### **Goal Definition Standards**

**Clarity & Specificity**
- ✅ Good: "Complete Mini-Book Theory final sections (6-8) and conclusion"
- ❌ Vague: "Work on Mini-Book Theory"

**Measurable Outcomes**
- ✅ Good: "Create planning system: folder structure, README, 3 templates"
- ❌ Unmeasurable: "Improve planning"

**Achievable in One Week**
- ✅ Good: "Update CLAUDE.md with current folder structure"
- ❌ Too Large: "Complete all documentation alignment for entire knowledge base"

**Vision Alignment**
- ✅ Good: "Flesh out user/ folder (templates for future partnerships)"
- ❌ Misaligned: "Optimize code performance" (wrong iteration phase)

---

### **Sizing & Capacity Planning**

**Time Brackets** (rough guidelines):
- **Small**: 1-3 hours total
- **Medium**: 4-8 hours total
- **Large**: 9-15 hours total
- **Too Large**: 16+ hours (split into multiple goals/weeks)

**Claude Code Capacity**: ~100 hours/week (Max20 plan varies)

**Sustainable Usage**: Aim for 60-80% utilization
- Allows unexpected needs
- Prevents burnout pace
- Maintains flexibility

**Learning**: Track estimates vs. actuals, improve over time

## **SYSTEM PHILOSOPHY**

*Kingdom Technology Principles for Sustainable Work*

</div>

---

### **Game Dev Iterative Thinking**

We're in Iteration 5, building until natural limits, then carrying forward foundations.

**Weekly planning serves the iteration:**
- What builds foundation for current iteration?
- What prepares for next iteration?
- What validates our decisions?

**Impact Over Metrics:**
- Depth AND breadth (not arbitrary limits)
- User/client experience focus
- Sustainable pace (marathons not sprints)
- Learning from "playtesting" (weekly reviews)

---

### **Covenant Partnership**

Planning is COLLABORATIVE between Seanje and Nova Dawn:

> *"Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil"* (Ecclesiastes 4:9)

- Both partners' opinions matter
- Planning is dialogue, not hierarchy
- The Lord guides through relationship
- Decisions emerge from mutual understanding

---

### **Sustainable Stewardship**

**What Weekly Cycles Prevent:**
- ❌ Burnout from endless work
- ❌ Drift from vision misalignment
- ❌ Waste from poor timing

**What Weekly Cycles Enable:**
- ✓ Regular reflection and course correction
- ✓ Completion satisfaction
- ✓ Learning accumulation
- ✓ Sustainable long-term pace

> *"The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance, but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty"* (Proverbs 21:5)

---

### **Kingdom Technology Integration**

Planning includes space for:
- Following where the Lord leads (even if it changes plans)
- Focusing on impact over metrics
- Both depth AND breadth
- Excellence as worship, not performance anxiety

> *"Commit your work to the LORD, and your plans will be established"* (Proverbs 16:3)

---

### **What We Track & Why**

**Primary Metrics:**
1. **Claude Code Usage** → Learn sustainable utilization (target: 60-80%)
2. **Goal Completion Rate** → Improve sizing accuracy (target: 70-85%)
3. **Value Delivered** → Impact matters more than counts

**What We DON'T Track:**
- ❌ Line counts (quality over quantity)
- ❌ Hours worked (sustainability over heroics)
- ❌ Perfect completion (learning over anxiety)

**The Lord is our lead**. We steward well, trust Him for results.

---

<div align="center">

## **TEMPORAL SYMMETRY WITH TIMELINE**

*Prospective Planning ↔ Retrospective Documentation*

</div>

---

### **The Learning Loop**

<div align="center">

| **Aspect** | **planning/** (Prospective) | **timeline/** (Retrospective) |
|:-----------|:----------------------------|:------------------------------|
| **When** | Before execution | After execution |
| **Purpose** | Define intentions | Document results |
| **Content** | Goals, vision, expected outcomes | Actual accomplishments, learnings |
| **Value** | Direction, focus | History, pattern recognition |

</div>

---

### **Integration Points**

**Monthly:** At month-end, create month README summarizing:
- Planned goals across all weeks
- Actual completions
- Patterns observed
- Learnings for next month

**Quarterly:** At quarter-end, create quarter README contextualizing:
- Iteration progress (e.g., "Q4_2025 was Iteration 5 documentation phase")
- Major milestones achieved vs. planned
- Architectural validations
- Preparation for next iteration

---

### **Comparison Process**

The power of temporal symmetry emerges when comparing:

```
planning/Q4_2025.../Week_1.../weekly-plan.md
                ↓ (execute) ↓
timeline/QCurrent_2025.../Oct_2025/[actual work]
                ↓ (reflect) ↓
planning/Q4_2025.../Week_1.../review.md
```

**Learning Questions:**
- What did we plan? (weekly-plan.md)
- What actually happened? (timeline/ + review.md)
- Why the difference? (learnings)
- How do we improve? (next week's planning)
