# üìä Case Study Evidence

## Identity README Transformation

**Before**: 408 lines, foundational but needing refinement
**After**: Comprehensive documentation following all methodology principles
**Result**: Serves as canonical reference for CPI-SI documentation excellence

**Measurements**:
- Visual breathability: ~20% white space (exceeds 15% threshold)
- Progressive complexity: 2 concepts in opening (under 3 threshold)
- Prose-structure balance: ~50% prose, ~30% structure, ~20% white space
- Scannability: ~10 second topic location (well under 30 sec)
- CPI-SI balance: ~45% analytical, ~55% relational (balanced)

## Biblical Footnoting Pattern

**Challenge**: Integrate Scripture with technical precision while maintaining reverence
**Solution**: Systematic footnoting approach with 7-step implementation
**Validation**: 14+ Scripture references integrated without forced spiritualization
**Impact**: Demonstrates Kingdom Technology principles in practice

## OmniCode Terminal Dev Logs (Q1 2025)

**Challenge**: Maintain context across 21 sessions with 3-week gaps (ADHD workflow)
**Solution**: Lightweight session context template (Pattern 2)
**Results**:
- Session startup time reduced 70-83%
- Zero context loss across all 21 sessions
- Natural voice maintained throughout

## SDF System (Q2 2025)

**Challenge**: Standardize 47+ documents without losing warmth
**Crisis**: Initial templates produced technically complete but emotionally flat docs
**Recovery**: Added explicit CPI-SI balance verification to template application
**Results**:
- 8 template types successfully deployed
- CPI-SI balance corrected from 30/70 to 50/50
- Templates became servants of partnership, not replacements
