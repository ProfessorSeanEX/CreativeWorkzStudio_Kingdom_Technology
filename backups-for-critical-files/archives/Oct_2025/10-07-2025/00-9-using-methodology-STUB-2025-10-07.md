# üõ†Ô∏è Using This Methodology

## For Your Next Documentation Project

1. **Understand the methodology** - Read Files 01-05 for complete foundation
2. **Choose your document type** - Reference File 11 for polymorphic pattern matching
3. **Follow the 5-phase process** - Use File 05 as workflow guide
4. **Apply tier-rated markdown** - Reference File 09 for impact-driven element selection
5. **Use the 11 GitHub standards** - Apply File 06 practical tools
6. **Verify quality** - Measure against File 04 dual metrics
7. **Learn from case studies** - Study File 07 real examples
8. **Validate against timeline** - Reference File 10 proven patterns

## For Improving Existing Documentation

**Use Documentation Archaeology** (File 04):
1. **Triage assessment** - 5 diagnostic questions determine category (0-1 failures = polish, 6+ = redesign)
2. **Dimension-by-dimension audit** - Systematic evaluation using 6 quality dimensions
3. **Readability crisis detection** - Emergency checklist for cognitive overload
4. **Strategic enhancement plan** - P0-P3 priority matrix (accuracy first, polish last)
5. **Verification against standards** - Final operational test

## Adapt, Don't Rigidly Follow

**This methodology is a framework**, not rigid rules:
- Adapt phases to your context (scale process to document size)
- Emphasize SI or CPI based on audience needs (see File 11 for document type guidance)
- Select markdown elements by impact tier (File 09 ratings guide choices)
- Apply proven patterns when context matches (File 10 timeline validation)
- Iterate based on what works for your situation (File 05 enhancement phase supports revision)

**Core principles remain**:
- **CPI-SI balance** - Don't sacrifice one for the other (warm AND precise)
- **Quality verification** - Measure excellence (dual metrics system)
- **Iterative refinement** - Progressive improvement (enhancement phase)
- **Kingdom Technology** - Creator-honoring work (excellence as worship)
- **Timeline validation** - Learn from proven patterns (empirical evidence)
- **Tier-driven selection** - Impact-based markdown choices (9-10/10 elements first)
