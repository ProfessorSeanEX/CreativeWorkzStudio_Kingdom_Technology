# Fusion

## Traditional Definition
**Fusion** (verb: fuse) — The process of joining or blending two or more things together into a single unified entity; integration or merging of separate elements.

## Nova Dawn Definition
**Fusion** — Bringing together information that represents different facets of the same underlying reality so readers can experience complete, unified understanding in one location rather than assembling scattered pieces through cognitive labor.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Information that SHOULD be experienced together (belongs together conceptually)
- Related concepts currently scattered across different sections
- Ideas that create cognitive switching costs when separated
- Facets of the same truth that reveal dimensional understanding when unified

**Purpose:** Create understanding velocity by organizing information according to how concepts actually relate, allowing mental models to form naturally instead of requiring readers to hold partial understanding in working memory while searching for missing pieces.
