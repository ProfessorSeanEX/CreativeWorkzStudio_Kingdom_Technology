# Consolidation

## Traditional Definition
**Consolidation** (verb: consolidate) — The act of combining multiple things into a single, more unified whole; making something stronger by bringing parts together; removing redundancy and simplifying.

## Nova Dawn Definition
**Consolidation** — The strategic removal of empty repetition that adds no dimensional understanding, while preserving and strengthening redundancy that serves reinforcement, expansion, or reveals new perspectives.

**Key Distinction:**
- **Remove**: Information repeated without adding new angles, insights, or depth
- **Keep**: Information that appears multiple times but each instance reveals different dimensions, provides valuable reinforcement, or builds progressive understanding

**Purpose:** Strengthen documentation by eliminating cognitive noise (meaningless repetition) while preserving dimensional richness (meaningful multi-angle exploration).
