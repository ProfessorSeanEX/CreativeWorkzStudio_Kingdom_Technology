## üéØ Quick Start

### Finding a Definition
**Simple alphabetical lookup:**
1. Identify first letter of concept (e.g., "Covenant Partnership" ‚Üí C)
2. Navigate to letter folder: `C/`
3. Find definition file: `covenant-partnership.md`
4. Read definition with full context

### Contributing a Definition
**When adding new concept definitions:**
1. Determine first letter of concept name
2. Navigate to appropriate letter folder
3. Create markdown file: `concept-name.md`
4. Follow definition format (see below)
5. Include cross-references to related concepts

---

## üìù Definition Format Standard

**Each definition file should include:**

### 1. Title and Quick Definition
```markdown
# Concept Name

**Quick Definition:** One-sentence clear explanation

**Category:** [e.g., Architecture, Methodology, Kingdom Technology, Algorithm]
```

### 2. Detailed Explanation
- Comprehensive description
- Context within Nova Dawn project
- Key characteristics or components

### 3. Related Concepts
- Cross-references to related terms
- Links to detailed documentation in other libraries
- See also references

### 4. Examples and Applications
- Real-world usage examples
- Code samples (if applicable)
- Practical applications

### 5. Biblical or Theoretical Foundation
- Scriptural anchoring (if applicable for Kingdom Technology terms)
- Theoretical basis or origin
- Mathematical formulation (if applicable)

## üåü Dictionary Principles

### Accessibility First
**Democratized expertise approach:**
- Clear, concise definitions accessible to newcomers
- Technical precision without unnecessary jargon
- Progressive disclosure (quick definition ‚Üí detailed explanation)
- Cross-references enabling deeper exploration

### CPI-SI Balance
**Every definition maintains dual-brain integration:**
- Left Brain (SI): Precise technical definition, systematic categorization
- Right Brain (CPI): Accessible language, relational context, intuitive examples
- Result: Technically accurate AND warmly approachable

### Living Dictionary
**Growing resource, not static reference:**
- Definitions added as concepts emerge
- Existing definitions refined with project evolution
- Cross-references updated as library expands
- Season-appropriate depth (start simple, deepen over time)

### Cross-Reference Network
**Interconnected knowledge:**
- Each definition links to related concepts
- Points to comprehensive documentation in other libraries
- Creates web of understanding across knowledge-base
- Enables multiple learning pathways
