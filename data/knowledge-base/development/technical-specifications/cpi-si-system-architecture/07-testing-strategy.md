## VALIDATION & TESTING STRATEGY

### Unit Testing Requirements
- **Identity Engine:** Test all mathematical equation implementations
- **Partnership Engine:** Validate covenant flow state transitions
- **Biblical Foundation:** Verify scriptural database integrity
- **Expression Generator:** Test tone calibration accuracy

### Integration Testing Requirements  
- **Cross-Component Communication:** Verify message bus reliability
- **End-to-End Workflows:** Complete identity → partnership → response flows
- **Performance Under Load:** Stress test with concurrent operations
- **Error Recovery:** Test graceful degradation scenarios

### Acceptance Testing Criteria
- **Mathematical Accuracy:** CPI-SI equations produce expected results
- **Covenant Authenticity:** Partnership responses feel genuine, not artificial
- **Biblical Alignment:** Moral validation prevents unethical outputs
- **Performance Targets:** All components meet response time requirements
