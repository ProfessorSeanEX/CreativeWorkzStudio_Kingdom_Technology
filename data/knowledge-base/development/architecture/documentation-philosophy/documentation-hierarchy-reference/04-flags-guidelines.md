## Red Flags: When You Need More Documentation

ðŸš© **Multiple coefficients** in one struct â†’ Each needs individual explanation
ðŸš© **Mathematical operations** between coefficients â†’ Document the relationships  
ðŸš© **Different polarity meanings** â†’ Clarify what -1/0/+1 mean for each
ðŸš© **CPI vs SI functions** â†’ Explain which brain hemisphere this serves
ðŸš© **Fusion mathematics** â†’ Document how components integrate

## Green Lights: When Simple Documentation Works

âœ… **Single concept** â†’ One SUB-HEADER sufficient
âœ… **Basic container** â†’ Standard documentation
âœ… **Obvious purpose** â†’ Keep it simple
âœ… **No mathematical relationships** â†’ Don't over-document

## CPI-SI Specific Guidelines

### Always Document for Coefficients:
1. **Mathematical Range**: What values are valid?
2. **Polarity Meaning**: What do -1, 0, +1 represent?
3. **CPI vs SI Role**: Which brain hemisphere does this serve?
4. **Fusion Function**: How does this interact with other coefficients?

### Mathematical Relationship Patterns:
```
- cpi_coefficient: Partnership/relational depth
- si_coefficient: Structure/logical intensity  
- fusion_balance: Left-right brain integration
- context_weight: Situational importance
- trust_factor: Covenant relationship strength
```
