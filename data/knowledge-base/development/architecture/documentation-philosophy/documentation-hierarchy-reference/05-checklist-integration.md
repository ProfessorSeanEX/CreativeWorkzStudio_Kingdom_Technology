## Implementation Checklist

Before finalizing documentation:

□ **Visual level assessed** - Delimiter intensity matches complexity and nesting depth
□ **Delimiter pattern correct** - Using === for major sections, --- for sub-items
□ **Mathematical clarity** - Coefficient meanings are explicit  
□ **CPI-SI integration** - Brain hemisphere roles are clear
□ **Polarity definitions** - What -1/0/+1 mean is documented
□ **Visual consistency** - Similar complexity items have similar delimiter patterns
□ **Navigation clarity** - Visual hierarchy supports code scanning and understanding

## Integration with Existing Architecture

This Visual Hierarchy System works **within** the 4-Block Structure:
- **METADATA** (MAIN SECTION): Overall file context and architectural understanding
- **OPENING** (MAIN SECTION): Declarations and API surface  
- **BODY** (MAIN SECTION): Core implementations using visual hierarchy
- **CLOSING** (MAIN SECTION): Integration points and future considerations
