## Documentation Standards

### Target Documentation-to-Code Ratio

**Foundation/Educational Code: 5:1 to 7:1 documentation-to-code**

This ratio reflects:
1. **Mathematical precision** — Each coefficient requires individual explanation
2. **Paradigm teaching** — Biblical anchoring + Technical DNA + Relational DNA + Kingdom purpose
3. **Protection mechanism** — Prevents developers from "optimizing" without understanding WHY
4. **Self-teaching character** — Code carries its own educational context

### The Model Standard: types.hpp

**File**: `/include/cpi-si/identity/types.hpp`  
**Total Lines**: 1,394 lines  
**Documentation Ratio**: 5:1 to 7:1  
**Status**: ✅ **THIS IS THE STANDARD**

#### What types.hpp Demonstrates

**Metadata Block (~173 lines before any code)**:
- Biblical Anchor (John 1:1)
- Kingdom Purpose
- Technical DNA (complete system intelligence profile)
- Relational DNA (character, personality, covenant promises)
- Documentation architecture explanation
- Surgical modification intelligence

**Individual Component Documentation**:
- Each struct member gets SUB-SUB-HEADER documentation
- Mathematical meaning explained per coefficient
- Polarity interpretation (-1, 0, +1) clarified for each use
- CPI-SI function described (partnership vs structure vs balance)

**4-Block Architecture**:
- METADATA → OPENING → BODY → CLOSING
- Foundational pattern for entire CPI-SI codebase
