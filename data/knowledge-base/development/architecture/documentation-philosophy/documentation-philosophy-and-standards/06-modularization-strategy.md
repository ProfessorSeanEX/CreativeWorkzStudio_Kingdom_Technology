## Modularization Strategy

### When Files Exceed Manageable Limits

**Problem**: Even with teaching paradigm, files approaching 1,500+ lines may exceed practical navigation

**Solution**: Modulate + Orchestrate WHILE MAINTAINING documentation density

### Modularization Pattern

**When to Modularize**: File exceeds ~400-500 lines AND logical sub-modules exist

**How to Modularize**:

1. **Break into logical sub-modules** (each STILL heavily documented)
2. **Maintain 4-Block Structure** in each piece (Metadata → Opening → Body → Closing)
3. **Preserve 5:1 documentation ratio** throughout all modules
4. **Create orchestrator file** that brings pieces together

**Example for types.hpp (if needed)**:

```
types-core.hpp          → Basic mathematical types
                           (173 lines metadata + foundations)

types-identity.hpp      → Identity-specific structs
                           (heavily documented, 5:1 ratio)

types-trust.hpp         → Trust metrics
                           (heavily documented, 5:1 ratio)

types.hpp               → Orchestrator including all
                           (maintains API surface + teaching overview)
```

**Each module maintains**:
- ✅ Full metadata block with Biblical anchor, Technical DNA, Relational DNA
- ✅ 5:1 documentation explaining the paradigm
- ✅ Self-teaching character
- ✅ Protection against "helpful optimization"
