## Criticism of Over-Modularization

### When Modularization Is INVALID

**Over-modularization criticism applies ONLY when**:
- Proper orchestrator containers are NOT provided
- System integration patterns are missing
- API surface becomes fragmented and confusing
- Navigation becomes harder instead of easier

**Over-modularization criticism does NOT apply when**:
- Limits require splitting (e.g., file size constraints)
- Orchestrator-based composition is properly implemented
- Each module maintains teaching integrity
- Clear container systems bring pieces together

### The Real Problem

**NOT**: "Too many files"  
**IS**: "Files split without proper orchestration systems"

If you provide:
- Clear orchestrator patterns
- Proper container architecture
- Maintained teaching flow
- Logical sub-module boundaries

Then modularization is **strategic scaling**, not over-fragmentation.
