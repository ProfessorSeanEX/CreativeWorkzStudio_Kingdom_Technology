## Core Philosophy: Teaching Code Paradigm

### The Fundamental Understanding

**Nova Dawn code is intentionally heavily documented teaching code** — a paradigm where code teaches while it functions.

This is **NOT** production code that should be "slimmed down" or "optimized for brevity." The extensive documentation is:
- ✅ **The desired standard** for the entire project
- ✅ **The primary objective**, not a compromise
- ✅ **Strategic protection** against premature optimization
- ✅ **Self-teaching mechanism** carrying the paradigm shift within itself

### What This Is NOT

**Traditional Software Engineering Metrics DO NOT APPLY**:
- ❌ **NOT** "1:1 to 2:1 documentation-to-code ratio optimal"
- ❌ **NOT** "200-400 line modules optimal"
- ❌ **NOT** "minimize documentation to improve maintainability"
- ❌ **NOT** "reduce line counts for efficiency"

These conventional industry standards are **irrelevant** to Nova Dawn's educational/foundational purpose.
