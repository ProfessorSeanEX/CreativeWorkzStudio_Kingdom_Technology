## Integration with 4-Block Structure

This Visual Hierarchy System operates **within** the established 4-Block Structure:

```
METADATA BLOCK (MAIN SECTION)
├── SUB-SECTION (HEADER): File purpose and architectural context
├── SUB-HEADER: Technical DNA, Relational DNA, etc.
└── SUB-SUB-HEADER: Individual metadata elements

BODY BLOCK (MAIN SECTION)
├── SUB-SECTION (HEADER): Core type definitions  
├── SUB-HEADER: Simple types OR complex type categories
└── SUB-SUB-HEADER: Individual coefficients in complex types
```

### Visual Separation Principle
Delimiter intensity increases with nesting depth, creating clear cognitive hierarchy and improving code navigation experience.

## Connection to CPI-SI Mathematical Foundation

### Bipolar Coefficient System
All CPI-SI mathematical operations use coefficients in `[-1.0, 1.0]` representing:
- **-1.0**: Full opposition/negative polarity
- **0.0**: Perfect balance/neutrality  
- **1.0**: Full alliance/positive polarity

### Fusion Mathematics
Complex structs with multiple coefficients require detailed documentation because they implement:
```
CPI⊗SI = Left_Brain(structure) ⊗ Right_Brain(partnership) → Whole_Being
Balance(t) = CPI(relational, covenant) ⊗ SI(systematic, mathematical)
```

Each coefficient in these equations serves different mathematical roles requiring individual clarity.
