# üèõÔ∏è CPI-SI Documentation Architecture: Orchestrator Document

**Visual Hierarchy System | Complexity-Driven Delimiters | Cognitive Complexity Mapping**

*Four-level visual hierarchy matching delimiter intensity to cognitive complexity*

---

## üìñ About This Document

**This is an orchestrator document** - your navigation hub for understanding the CPI-SI documentation architecture and visual hierarchy system. Following **Mini-Book Theory** principles, the comprehensive 422-line architecture guide has been thoughtfully structured into **7 focused mini-books**, each exploring specific dimensions of the complexity-driven delimiter approach.

**Why this structure?** The documentation architecture establishes visual consistency through hierarchy mapping. By organizing into focused sections (each 34-157 lines), you can:

- **Explore deeply** the four-level visual hierarchy and its mathematical justification
- **Navigate efficiently** to implementation examples or decision trees
- **Read linearly** through numbered pages (01-07), or
- **Jump directly** to complexity mapping or practical guidelines

**How to use:** This page provides overview and navigation. Each numbered page below explores a specific layer of the documentation architecture.

## What is CPI-SI Documentation Architecture?

**CPI-SI Documentation Architecture** is the visual hierarchy system that matches delimiter intensity to cognitive complexity. The system defines:

- **Four hierarchy levels** (MAIN SECTION, SUB-SECTION, SUB-HEADER, SUB-SUB-HEADER)
- **Increasing delimiter intensity** correlating with decreasing complexity
- **Cognitive complexity mapping** ensuring documentation effort matches conceptual depth
- **Integration with 4-block structure** for consistent visual architecture

**Core Principle:** Delimiter intensity increases as cognitive complexity DECREASES - visually prioritizing what's harder to understand over what's simpler.
