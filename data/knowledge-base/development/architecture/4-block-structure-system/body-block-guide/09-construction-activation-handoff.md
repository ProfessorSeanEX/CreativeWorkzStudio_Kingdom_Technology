## ðŸ”„ CONSTRUCTION-TO-ACTIVATION HANDOFF

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Critical Architectural Boundary**  
> The handoff from body block to closing block is where **construction ends and operation begins**. The body block builds and prepares; the closing block receives and activates. Clear interfaces at this boundary prevent architectural confusion.

### Body-to-Closing Block Interface
```cpp
// BODY BLOCK: Preparing handoff to closing block
struct ConstructedSystem {
    // What we built
    std::vector<Component> components;
    std::vector<Connection> connections;
    IntegrationStatus integration;
    
    // Ready for activation?
    bool ready_for_activation() const;
    
    // Handoff to closing block
    ActivationHandle prepare_activation() const;
};
```

### Construction Completion Signal
```cpp
// BODY BLOCK: Signaling construction complete
class ConstructionComplete {
    ConstructedSystem system;
    ActivationReadiness readiness;
    
    // Hand over to closing block for activation
    void transfer_to_activation_layer();
};
```

## ðŸŽ¯ CONSTRUCTION VS ACTIVATION CLARITY

### **Body Block Responsibilities (Construction)**
- âœ… Build individual components
- âœ… Establish component connections
- âœ… Assemble integrated systems
- âœ… Prepare for activation
- âœ… Quality assurance of construction

### **Closing Block Responsibilities (Activation)**
- âœ… Initialize constructed systems
- âœ… Start operational processes
- âœ… Provide usage examples
- âœ… Demonstrate working system
- âœ… Operational context and patterns

### **Perfect Division of Labor**
**Body Block:** *"I built the machine and all its parts are connected properly"*
**Closing Block:** *"I'm turning on the machine and showing how it works"*
