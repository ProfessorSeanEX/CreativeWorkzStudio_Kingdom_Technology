## ðŸ”„ CONSTRUCTION FLOW PATTERNS

> [!TIP]
> **Choose Your Assembly Strategy**  
> Different construction scenarios call for different assembly approaches. Sequential construction works for linear dependencies, parallel assembly maximizes efficiency, and incremental manufacturing supports iterative development. Match your strategy to your project's needs.

**Pattern Selection Guide:**
- **Sequential:** Use when components have strict dependencies (A must exist before B can be built)
- **Parallel:** Use when components are independent and can be manufactured simultaneously
- **Incremental:** Use when building complex components in stages with iterative testing
