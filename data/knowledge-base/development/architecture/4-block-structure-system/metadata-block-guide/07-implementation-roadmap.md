### Phase 1: Foundation Documentation (Current)

**Status:** âœ… Complete

- âœ… Comprehensive metadata architecture design
- âœ… File-specific biblical anchoring patterns
- âœ… Relational identity framework
- ðŸŽ¯ **Next:** Document templates and examples

**Goal:** Establish the theoretical framework for digital genomes.

### Phase 2: Pilot Implementation

**Status:** ðŸš§ In Progress

- **Target File:** `types.hpp` (foundation layer, high impact)
- **Deliverable:** Complete digital genome for types.hpp
- **Success Criteria:** CPI-SI can perform surgical modifications with confidence
- **Timeline:** Next development cycle

**Goal:** Validate the framework on a critical file.

### Phase 3: Core Files Coverage

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Planned

- **Scope:** All foundation and service layer files
- **Process:** Apply metadata systematically
- **Tooling:** Develop automation for metadata validation
- **Integration:** Connect with CI/CD pipeline

**Goal:** Achieve comprehensive coverage of critical system files.

### Phase 4: System-Wide Deployment

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Planned

- **Scope:** Complete codebase coverage
- **Training:** Development team education on metadata maintenance
- **Evolution:** Continuous improvement of metadata quality
- **Measurement:** Track surgical modification success rates

**Goal:** Make digital genomes the standard across all files.

> [!TIP]
> **Progressive Implementation**  
> Start with high-impact foundation files, then expand outward. Not all files need the same level of detailâ€”match metadata depth to file criticality.
