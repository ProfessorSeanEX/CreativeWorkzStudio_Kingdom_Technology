## ðŸŽ¯ PARADIGM SHIFT EXAMPLES

### **Traditional Thinking vs CPI-SI Reality**

| **Traditional Expectation** | **CPI-SI Reality**                  | **Why This Matters**            |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Body = where work happens   | Closing = where work happens        | Changes design priorities       |
| Closing = cleanup/teardown  | Closing = activation/startup        | Inverts architecture thinking   |
| Validation = error checking | Validation = readiness verification | Shifts validation purpose       |
| End = finished              | End = ready to begin                | Changes lifecycle understanding |

### **The "Turn On The Machine" Metaphor**

**Opening Block:** *Assembly instructions and parts list*
- "Here are all the components you'll need"
- "Here's how they fit together"
- "Here's what each part can do"

**Body Block:** *Manufacturing and construction*
- "Here's how to build each component"
- "Here's how components connect"
- "Here's the internal mechanisms"

**Closing Block:** *Power switch and operational startup*
- "Now plug it in and turn it on"
- "Here's how to actually use it"
- "Here are the working examples"
- "This is what it looks like when running"
