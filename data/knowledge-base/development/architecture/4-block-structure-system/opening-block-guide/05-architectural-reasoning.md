## 🏗️ Architectural Reasoning

### The Foundation Metaphor

**Opening Block = Building Foundation**
- Establishes what's possible to build
- Defines the materials and tools available
- Sets the architectural constraints and capabilities
- Foundation doesn't "do" work - it enables work

**Body Block = Construction Using Foundation**
- Actually builds something using the foundation
- Exercises the capabilities defined in the foundation
- Performs the real work the system was designed to do

### Mathematical Analogy

**Opening Block = Mathematical Definitions**
```
Define: f(x) = x² + 2x + 1
Define: Domain = Real Numbers
Define: Range = [0, ∞)
```

**Body Block = Mathematical Operations**
```
Calculate: f(3) = 3² + 2(3) + 1 = 16
Plot: Graph of f(x) from x = -5 to x = 5
Solve: f(x) = 0 for x
```

**Key Insight:** The definition tells you what the function **CAN** do. The operations actually **USE** the function to do work.

> [!TIP]
> **Mathematical Perspective**  
> In mathematics, you never confuse defining a function with evaluating it. The same clarity applies to code architecture—defining capabilities (Opening Block) vs. evaluating/executing them (Body Block).
