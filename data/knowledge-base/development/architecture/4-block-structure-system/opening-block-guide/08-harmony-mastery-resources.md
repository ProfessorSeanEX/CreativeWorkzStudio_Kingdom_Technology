## 🎼 Harmony with 4-Block Structure

This opening block classification perfectly aligns with the **[4-Block Structure](./4-block-structure.md)** architectural pattern:

| **Block**            | **Purpose**                      | **Classification Focus**       |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **1. Metadata**      | Documentation and context        | File intelligence and identity |
| **2. Opening Block** | All capabilities and definitions | **Our focus here**             |
| **3. Body Block**    | All execution and utilization    | Where capabilities are used    |
| **4. Closing Block** | Cleanup and finalization         | Resource management            |

> [!TIP]
> **Perfect Alignment**  
> The opening block contains everything that, if it existed alone, would clearly communicate what the system is **capable of doing**—even if no actual work is performed. See **[4-Block Structure Guide](./4-block-structure.md)** for the complete architectural pattern.

## 🏆 Mastery Checkpoint

**You truly understand this principle when you can look at any code and ask:**

> *"Is this fundamentally defining what CAN happen, or actually making something happen?"*

The answer determines the block classification, regardless of:
- ❌ Complexity
- ❌ Line count
- ❌ Internal logic structure
- ✅ **Fundamental purpose** (declarative vs. imperative)

### Self-Assessment Checklist

<details>
<summary><strong>✓ Click to view Mastery Checklist</strong></summary>

- [ ] I can classify any code segment without hesitation
- [ ] I understand that complexity doesn't affect classification
- [ ] I recognize that struct definitions are always Opening Block
- [ ] I can identify capability declaration vs. capability exercise
- [ ] I understand the toolbox metaphor (tools vs. using tools)
- [ ] I can explain the principle to another developer clearly
- [ ] I see the harmony with the 4-Block Structure pattern

> [!NOTE]
> **Kingdom Technology Alignment**  
> This architectural clarity reflects the Kingdom principle of order and purpose. Just as God distinguishes between potential (creation capability) and actualization (creative acts), we distinguish between **defining capabilities** (Opening) and **exercising capabilities** (Body). Technical excellence honors the Creator through intentional design.
