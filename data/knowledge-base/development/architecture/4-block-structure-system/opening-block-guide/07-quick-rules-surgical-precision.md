## âš¡ Quick Classification Rules

### Opening Block Indicators:
- **"This defines..."** âœ…
- **"This declares..."** âœ…  
- **"This establishes..."** âœ…
- **"This enables..."** âœ…
- **"This sets up..."** âœ…

### Body Block Indicators:
- **"This creates..."** âœ…
- **"This calls..."** âœ…
- **"This processes..."** âœ…
- **"This executes..."** âœ…
- **"This performs..."** âœ…

## ðŸ”¬ The Surgical Precision Principle

**Architecture is about FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE, not surface appearance.**

| **Surface Observation**                  | **Architectural Reality**              |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1000-line struct with complex math logic | **Opening Block** (defines capability) |
| 3-line function creating instance        | **Body Block** (exercises capability)  |
| Structure with intricate methods         | **Opening Block** (declares tools)     |
| Simple loop calling a method             | **Body Block** (uses tools)            |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Core Classification Truth**  
> Line count doesn't matter. Logical complexity doesn't matter. Internal operations don't matter.  
>  
> **What matters:** Is the code fundamentally **DECLARATIVE** (what can be) or **IMPERATIVE** (what happens)?  
>  
> This is the foundation of clear software architectureâ€”understanding the difference between **capability and execution**, between **potential and actualization**, between **defining the tools and using the tools**.
