## 🗺️ Migration Strategy

Transitioning an existing codebase to 4-block structure requires **phased adoption**. Trying to convert everything at once creates chaos—instead, follow this systematic approach.

### Phase 1: 📚 Establish Pattern

**Goal:** Create the foundation and reference implementations.

- ✅ **Document the standard** → This document serves as the authoritative reference
- 🔍 **Identify exemplar files** → Find files that already follow similar patterns (even partially)
- 📄 **Create templates** → Build file templates for common use cases (classes, utilities, algorithms)
- 👥 **Team training** → Walk the team through the pattern and its benefits

**Success Metric:** Every developer understands the 4-block pattern and knows where to find the documentation.

### Phase 2: 🌱 Systematic Application

**Goal:** Apply the pattern progressively, starting with highest-value targets.

- 🆕 **New files first** → All new code follows 4-block structure from day one (enforce in code review)
- 📊 **High-frequency files next** → Refactor files that change most often (biggest ROI)
- 🏗️ **Gradual refactoring** → Convert existing files opportunistically (when you're already editing them)
- 📈 **Track adoption** → Maintain a metric: "% of files following 4-block structure"

**Success Metric:** 50%+ of frequently-changed files follow the pattern; new files are 100% compliant.

---

### Phase 3: 🔒 Enforcement

**Goal:** Make 4-block structure the default, with automated verification.

- 🤖 **Create linting rules** → Automate block structure validation (detect missing end tags, out-of-order elements)
- 📋 **Update development guidelines** → Make 4-block structure a requirement in coding standards
- 👀 **Code review checklist** → Include "Follows 4-block structure?" as a review gate
- 📚 **Onboarding integration** → New team members learn 4-block structure in their first week

**Success Metric:** 90%+ of files follow the pattern; violations are caught before merge.

> [!TIP]
> **Migration Tip:** Don't aim for perfection on day one. Even partial adoption provides value—a file with clear metadata and API blocks (Blocks 1-2) is better than unstructured code, even if Blocks 3-4 aren't fully separated yet. Progressive improvement is the goal.
