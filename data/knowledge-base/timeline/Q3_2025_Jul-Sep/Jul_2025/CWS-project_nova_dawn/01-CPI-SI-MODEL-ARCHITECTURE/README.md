## Documents in This Section

### technical-implementation-analysis.md

**Size:** ~9,500 words
**Focus:** Deep technical architecture reconstruction

**Contents:**
- Core architecture components (ModelFactory, OutputFormatter, Data Layer, Brain Orchestration)
- Build system architecture (CMake + Makefile dual system)
- Inside-out architecture implementation (6 layers: Divine Authority → External Interface)
- Performance architecture (game developer paradigm, sub-millisecond targets)
- Current implementation status (what works vs. needs refinement)
- Ladder & Baton methodology in practice
- Technical innovations summary
- Connection to vision evolution

**Read this for:**
- Understanding CPI-SI Model implementation
- Technical architecture patterns
- Inside-out architecture HOW (not just WHAT)
- Build system rationale
- Performance approach
- Current system state details

**Key Insights:**
- First working CPI-SI implementation across all repositories
- Inside-out architecture (spiritual → technical) COMPILES AND RUNS
- Dual build systems serving different purposes (CMake for comprehensiveness, Makefile for optimization)
- Data layer excellence (configs/foundation/memory/runtime)
- Foundation complete, integration refinement needed
