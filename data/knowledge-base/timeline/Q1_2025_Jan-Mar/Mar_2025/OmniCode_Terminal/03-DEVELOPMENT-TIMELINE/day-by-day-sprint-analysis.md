## Timeline Overview: 9 Days, 21 Dev Logs, 6,346 Lines of Core Code

★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
**Dev Log Structure Reveals ADHD-Aware Workflow:**

The "Session Hop Context" in every dev log demonstrates intentional design for hyperfocus development patterns:
- **What Was Just Completed** = Immediate achievement acknowledgment
- **What Needs Immediate Attention** = Priority anchoring before context loss
- **Where to Resume Development** = Clear re-entry point for next session

This isn't just documentation—it's **architectural scaffolding** for neurodivergent development flow. Each log provides mental state restoration after breaks, ensuring continuity despite non-linear work patterns.

## Day 1: February 28, 2025 - Foundation & Vision (dev_log_0)

### Biblical Foundation Established

**Date**: 2025-02-28 (2 days before GitHub repository creation)
**Status**: ✅ Project Structuring Completed
**Phase**: Initial Planning & System Design

### Work Completed

**1. OmniCode Execution Model Designed**
- Top-down reading, bottom-up validation architecture
- Structured execution flow (prevent instability from execution order issues)

**2. File Structure Fully Defined**
```
OmniCode_Terminal/
├── assembler/core/        # Core loaders (config, instruction, register)
├── config/                # JSON configuration files
├── docs/                  # Documentation and dev logs
├── logs/                  # Execution tracking
├── terminal/              # Execution environment
└── scripts/               # Validation and testing
```

**3. Game Engine Blueprint Outlined**
- Puzzle-solving mechanics via OmniCode programming
- Debugging as player-driven learning
- In-game scripting challenges

**4. Biblical Computing Alignment**
> "Order Before Execution → OmniCode's structure is intentionally defined before writing any functional code."

### Key Principles Established

**From dev_log_0.md**:
1. **Order Before Execution** - Structure before implementation
2. **Faith-Driven Development** - Biblical principles embedded in every layer
3. **Growth Must Be Intentional** - Expansion without breaking core functionality
4. **Real-Time Debugging as Core Priority** - Execution clarity for error identification

### Next Steps Planned

- Finalize core instruction definitions in `instruction_set.json`
- Define register allocations in `registers.json`
- Structure global configuration settings in `config.json`
- Implement config_loader.py, instruction_loader.py, register_loader.py

---

## Day 2: March 1, 2025 (Morning) - GitHub Repository Creation

### Commit 1: Initial Git Push (07:26 CST)

**Author**: Seanje Lenox-Wise
**Action**: Upload existing local work to GitHub
**Pattern**: Archiving in-progress development (similar to ProjectNovaDawn Oct 13, 2024)

**What Was Uploaded**:
- Assembler core structure (initial loader implementations)
- Configuration files (instruction_set.json, registers.json, config.json)
- Documentation framework
- Testing infrastructure placeholder

---

## Day 2: March 1, 2025 (Afternoon/Evening) - Core Loader Development

### Dev Log 1: Instruction Loader Completion (dev_log_1)

**Time**: Same day as GitHub push
**Component**: `instruction_loader.py`
**Status**: ✅ Completed – Pending Persistent Caching Update

**Work Completed**:
- Dynamic path resolution (`Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]`)
- Instruction validation from `instruction_set.json`
- Opcode lookup with fallback mechanism ("BE STILL" for unknown opcodes)
- Session-based caching implementation

**Issues Identified**:
⚠️ Cache only persists within single execution (needs file-based persistence)

**Gameplay Impact**:
> "The Instruction Loader is responsible for parsing, validating, and caching player-defined instructions, ensuring scripts execute efficiently within the OmniCode environment."

### Commit 2: Base v0.0 - Instruction Loader Completed (11:33 CST)

## Development Philosophy: Bible Study → Design → Implementation

### Every Session Workflow (from bible_study_1.md)

**1. Opening Every Session with Bible Study (15-30 Minutes)**
> "Before we code, before we build—we first seek wisdom, alignment, and purpose in God's Word."

**2. Reflection & Application**
- Psalm 127:1: "Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain"
- Proverbs 3:19-20: Wisdom, understanding, knowledge as engineering pillars

**3. Development Action Anchored in Scripture**
- Ensure Processing Layer structured with wisdom before features
- Like God's design, ensure systems interact properly before execution
- Testing & validation before proceeding

**4. Closing Prayer Before Coding**
> "Lord, we thank You for wisdom, for clarity, and for the ability to create. May this work always be aligned with Your purpose."

**5. Begin Work**
> "Now, we begin. The foundation is set, the direction is clear—let's start our work in God's wisdom."
