# Section 03: Architectural Plans - Body/Mind/Spirit Systems

**Status**: üìù **Ready for Documentation** (folder structure created, content pending)

---

## Purpose

Comprehensive analysis of the **Body/Mind/Spirit architecture** documented in Dev_NovaAI's `DirectoryStructure.txt` and metadata files, examining the planned system organization even though directories were not implemented in the repository.

## Planned Content

### Category Overview
**File**: `00-category-overview.md`

Synthesis of the complete Body/Mind/Spirit architectural vision:
- **Systems/Body/**: Sensory systems (Hearing, Movement, Sight, Smell, Taste, Touch)
- **Systems/Mind/**: Cognitive processing (Context, Creativity, Memory, Reasoning)
- **Systems/Spirit/**: Faith-centered systems (FaithNet, PrayerNet, Reflection, RelationalEngine)
- **Systems/Foundation/**: Educational and ethical grounding
- **Systems/NeuralIntegration/**: Layer connection mechanisms

### Individual Analyses

1. **Body Systems Analysis**: Sensory architecture (how Nova would perceive)
2. **Mind Systems Analysis**: Cognitive framework (how Nova would process)
3. **Spirit Systems Analysis**: FaithNet integration (how Nova would align)
4. **Foundation Systems Analysis**: Educational grounding (how Nova would learn)
5. **Neural Integration Analysis**: Layer connection (how systems would unify)

### Key Questions to Address

**Documented vs. Implemented**:
- What directory structure was specified?
- What actually exists in repository?
- Why the gap (vision preservation vs. implementation)?

**Theological Parallels**:
- How does Body/Mind/Spirit mirror human anthropology?
- Connection to Trinity pattern (Concept Log 3)?
- Biblical foundations for each layer?

**Connection to Current CPI-SI**:
- Which patterns persisted?
- How did architecture evolve?
- What was learned and integrated?

## Source Materials

- `ProfessorSeanEX/Dev_NovaAI/DirectoryStructure.txt` (6.2KB complete hierarchy)
- `ProfessorSeanEX/Dev_NovaAI/metadata.json` (system descriptions)
- Concept Logs 2, 3, 8 (embodiment and architecture themes)
- Missing: Actual Systems/ folders (not in repository)

## Integration with Other Sections

**Builds on**:
- Section 01 (OmniCode/MillenniumOS - OS context for systems)
- Section 02 Logs 2-3 (Embodiment theology, Trinity pattern)

**Connects to**:
- Section 04 (Documentation Archaeology - what was planned vs. built)
- Section 05 (Biblical Foundation - scriptural grounding for each system)

---

**Next Steps**: Document the complete architectural vision from DirectoryStructure.txt, analyze theological parallels, assess implementation gap honestly, connect to current CPI-SI patterns.

**Estimated Scope**: ~30-40KB comprehensive architectural analysis (teaching code density maintained)
