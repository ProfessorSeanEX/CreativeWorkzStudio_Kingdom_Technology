## OPENING BLOCK: Target Audience & Value Proposition

### Who Is Kasutamaiza For?

**From Repository Description**:
> "If you have a pure custom card server boy do I have the bot for you"

**Target Audience**: Discord servers focused on **custom Yu-Gi-Oh card creation** where:
- Players design original cards
- Community votes on/approves custom cards
- Custom cards integrated into server's gameplay
- Standard Yu-Gi-Oh rules apply with custom additions

**Pain Points Addressed**:

1. **Card Lookup Difficulty**: No official API for quick card reference
2. **Moderation Overhead**: Manual warning tracking, mute management
3. **Custom Card Chaos**: No workflow for submission ‚Üí review ‚Üí approval
4. **Deck Building Complexity**: Hard to validate legality, analyze synergy
5. **Community Engagement**: Need gamification (economy, levels, rewards)

**Kasutamaiza's Solution**: Integrated toolset handling card database, moderation, custom card workflow, deck analysis, and gamification in single bot.

### Feature Philosophy

**From README.md**:
> Kasutamaiza Bot is a powerful and modular Discord bot designed to enhance server engagement, provide utility features, and support Yu-Gi-Oh enthusiasts with custom commands.

**Design Principles**:

1. **Specialized, Not Generic**: Built for Yu-Gi-Oh communities, not general-purpose
2. **Automation Over Manual Work**: Automate moderation, card lookup, deck validation
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Basic features (card lookup) work immediately, advanced features (custom cards, tournaments) available when needed
4. **Community-Driven**: Features respond to actual community needs (custom card workflow = #1 requested feature)

### Feature Ecosystem Overview

**6 Feature Domains**:

| Domain | Commands/Features | Database Tables | Purpose |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Yu-Gi-Oh Core** | 6 commands | 4 tables | Card lookup, deck analysis |
| **Custom Cards** | Workflow system | 1 table | Card submission ‚Üí approval |
| **Moderation** | 6 commands | 1 table | Community management |
| **Economy** | Currency system | 4 tables | Virtual currency, marketplace |
| **Gamification** | Levels, rewards | 2 tables | Player progression |
| **Community** | Clans, events | 2 tables | Social features |

**Total**: 18+ user-facing features across 6 domains, supported by 14 database tables.

## BODY BLOCK: Feature Domain Analysis

### 1. Yu-Gi-Oh Core Features

**Purpose**: Provide essential Yu-Gi-Oh reference tools every player needs.

#### 1.1 Card Lookup (`/card_lookup`)

**User Story**: "As a player, I want to quickly look up card details during deck building or gameplay discussions."

**Workflow**:
1. User: `/card_lookup Blue-Eyes White Dragon`
2. Bot searches `card_library` table using full-text search
3. Bot displays card embed with name, type, ATK/DEF, effect text, image
4. Advanced: Multiple results ‚Üí pagination, filters by type/attribute

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
# In yugioh.py cog
@discord.slash_command(name="card_lookup", description="Search for a card")
async def card_lookup(self, ctx, query: str):
    # Full-text search using TSVECTOR
    results = await db_read("card_library", {
        "search_metadata": f"@@to_tsquery('english', '{query}')"
    })

    if not results:
        await ctx.respond("‚ùå No cards found", ephemeral=True)
        return

    card = parse_card_data(results[0])
    embed = create_embed(
        title=f"üÉè {card['name']}",
        description=card['description'],
        fields=[
            {"name": "Type", "value": card['type']},
            {"name": "ATK/DEF", "value": f"{card['attack']}/{card['defense']}"}
        ],
        thumbnail_url=card['image_url']
    )

    await ctx.respond(embed=embed)
```

**Database Integration**:
```sql
-- card_library table with full-text search
SELECT * FROM card_library
WHERE search_metadata @@ to_tsquery('english', 'Blue & Eyes');
```

**Community Value**:
- **Saves time**: Instant lookup vs. Google search
- **Context preservation**: Results in Discord, no context switching
- **Accessibility**: Mobile-friendly Discord interface

**Usage Statistics** (projected):
- **Most used command**: Estimated 60-70% of all command invocations
- **Daily usage**: 100-1000 lookups per day in active server (1000+ members)

#### 1.2 Deck Analysis (`/deck_analysis`)

**User Story**: "As a deck builder, I want feedback on my deck's legality, synergy, and weaknesses."

**Workflow**:
1. User uploads deck list (text file or deck_id)
2. Bot validates deck legality (40-60 cards, banlist compliance)
3. Bot analyzes archetype synergy (coherence score)
4. Bot predicts weaknesses (using AI recommendation helper)
5. Bot displays analysis embed with scores and suggestions

**Analysis Components**:

**A. Legality Check** (`validate_deck` helper):
```python
async def validate_deck(card_list):
    """
    Validate deck meets Yu-Gi-Oh rules.

    Checks:
    - Total cards: 40-60 (main deck)
    - Extra deck: 0-15 cards
    - Side deck: 0-15 cards
    - Banlist compliance: No banned cards, max 1 limited, max 2 semi-limited
    - Card limits: Max 3 copies per card

    Returns:
        {
            "legal": bool,
            "violations": [list of rule violations],
            "warnings": [list of recommendations]
        }
    """
    violations = []
    warnings = []

    # Count cards
    main_deck_count = len(card_list['main_deck'])
    if not (40 <= main_deck_count <= 60):
        violations.append(f"Main deck must be 40-60 cards (found {main_deck_count})")

    # Check banlist
    for card in card_list['main_deck']:
        restriction = await get_card_restriction(card['card_id'])
        if restriction == 'banned':
            violations.append(f"{card['name']} is banned")
        elif restriction == 'limited' and card['quantity'] > 1:
            violations.append(f"{card['name']} limited to 1 copy")

    return {
        "legal": len(violations) == 0,
        "violations": violations,
        "warnings": warnings
    }
```

**B. Synergy Analysis** (`validate_archetype_synergy` helper):
```python
async def validate_archetype_synergy(card_list):
    """
    Analyze deck coherence and archetype synergy.

    Algorithm:
    1. Identify primary archetype (most common card theme)
    2. Count support cards for primary archetype
    3. Calculate synergy score (0-10)
    4. Identify off-theme cards

    Returns:
        {
            "primary_archetype": str,
            "synergy_score": float (0-10),
            "support_percentage": float,
            "off_theme_cards": [list]
        }
    """
    # Count archetype occurrences
    archetype_counts = {}
    for card in card_list['main_deck']:
        archetype = await get_card_archetype(card['card_id'])
        archetype_counts[archetype] = archetype_counts.get(archetype, 0) + 1

    # Primary archetype = most common
    primary = max(archetype_counts, key=archetype_counts.get)

    # Calculate synergy score
    support_cards = archetype_counts.get(primary, 0)
    total_cards = len(card_list['main_deck'])
    support_percentage = (support_cards / total_cards) * 100

    # Score: 70%+ support = 9-10, 50-70% = 7-8, 30-50% = 5-6, <30% = 1-4
    if support_percentage >= 70:
        score = 9 + (support_percentage - 70) / 30  # 9-10 range
    elif support_percentage >= 50:
        score = 7 + (support_percentage - 50) / 20  # 7-9 range
    else:
        score = 1 + (support_percentage / 50) * 6  # 1-7 range

    return {
        "primary_archetype": primary,
        "synergy_score": round(score, 1),
        "support_percentage": round(support_percentage, 1),
        "off_theme_cards": [
            card for card in card_list['main_deck']
            if await get_card_archetype(card['card_id']) != primary
        ]
    }
```

**C. Weakness Prediction** (`predict_deck_weaknesses` from AI helper):
```python
async def predict_deck_weaknesses(card_list):
    """
    Use AI to predict deck vulnerabilities.

    Analyzes:
    - Removal resistance (can deck recover from board wipes?)
    - Hand trap presence (can deck stop opponent's plays?)
    - Consistency (brick probability)
    - Resource management (card advantage sustainability)

    Returns:
        List of predicted weaknesses
    """
    weaknesses = []

    # Check removal resistance
    board_wipe_recovery = await analyze_board_wipe_recovery(card_list)
    if board_wipe_recovery < 0.5:
        weaknesses.append("Low board wipe recovery (lacks floaters/recursion)")

    # Check hand trap count
    hand_traps = [card for card in card_list['main_deck']
                  if await is_hand_trap(card['card_id'])]
    if len(hand_traps) < 3:
        weaknesses.append("Insufficient hand traps (vulnerable to OTK)")

    # Check consistency
    starters = [card for card in card_list['main_deck']
                if await is_combo_starter(card['card_id'])]
    if len(starters) < 10:
        weaknesses.append("Low starter count (high brick probability)")

    return weaknesses
```

**Example Output**:
```
üìä Deck Analysis: Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX

‚úÖ Legality: Legal deck (60 cards)

üîó Synergy Score: 8.5/10
Primary Archetype: Blue-Eyes
Support Percentage: 75%

‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses:
- Insufficient hand traps (vulnerable to OTK)
- Low spell/trap removal (struggles vs. backrow-heavy decks)
- Inconsistent card advantage (lacks draw power)

üí° Recommendations:
- Add 3x Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring (hand trap)
- Consider 2x Twin Twisters (spell/trap removal)
- Include 1-2x Trade-In (draw power for high-level monsters)
```

**Community Value**:
- **Learning tool**: Helps players improve deck building
- **Pre-tournament validation**: Catch illegal decks before events
- **Meta awareness**: Weakness prediction teaches game theory

### 3. Moderation Features

**Purpose**: Lighten moderator workload through automation and logging.

#### 3.1 Core Moderation Commands

**From README.md**:
```
/kick [member] [reason]: Kick a member from the server.
/ban [member] [reason]: Ban a member from the server.
/mute [member] [duration] [reason]: Temporarily mute a member.
/unmute [member]: Unmute a member.
/purge [amount]: Delete multiple messages.
/warn [member] [reason]: Issue a warning to a member.
```

**Key Innovation**: **Database-backed moderation logging**

**Every action logged to `moderation_logs` table**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE moderation_logs (
    log_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    guild_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    moderator_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    target_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    action TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'kick', 'ban', 'mute', 'warn'
    reason TEXT,
    duration INT,  -- For mutes (minutes)
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

**Example: Warning Escalation**:
```
User receives 1st warning: Logged to database
User receives 2nd warning: Logged, bot sends moderator alert
User receives 3rd warning: Auto-mute for 1 hour (escalation)
User receives 4th warning: Manual moderator intervention required
```

**Implementation** (from advanced_moderation_helper):
```python
async def escalate_violation(guild, member, reason):
    """
    Automatically escalate penalties based on violation history.

    Escalation ladder:
    1 warning -> Log only
    2 warnings -> DM warning to user
    3 warnings -> 1-hour mute
    4 warnings -> 24-hour mute
    5 warnings -> Kick
    6 warnings -> Ban (requires manual mod approval)
    """
    # Count warnings
    warnings = await db_read("moderation_logs", {
        "guild_id": guild.id,
        "target_id": member.id,
        "action": "warn"
    })

    warning_count = len(warnings)

    if warning_count >= 3 and warning_count < 4:
        # Auto-mute 1 hour
        await mute_user(guild, member, duration=60, reason="3 warnings accumulated")
        await send_alert(guild, f"‚ö†Ô∏è {member.mention} auto-muted (3 warnings)")

    elif warning_count >= 5:
        # Kick
        await kick_user(guild, member, reason="5 warnings accumulated")
        await send_alert(guild, f"üö´ {member.mention} auto-kicked (5 warnings)")
```

#### 3.2 Advanced Moderation

**From helper_module_metadata.md - Advanced Moderation Helper**:

**Automated Rule Enforcement**:
```python
async def detect_prohibited_patterns(message_content):
    """
    Scan message for prohibited content.

    Detects:
    - Profanity (customizable word list)
    - Spam patterns (repeated messages, excessive caps)
    - Invite links (to other Discord servers)
    - Phishing links (known malicious domains)

    Returns:
        {
            "violation_detected": bool,
            "violation_type": str,
            "severity": int (1-10)
        }
    """
    # Check profanity
    if await contains_profanity(message_content):
        return {"violation_detected": True, "violation_type": "profanity", "severity": 5}

    # Check spam
    if message_content.isupper() and len(message_content) > 50:
        return {"violation_detected": True, "violation_type": "spam_caps", "severity": 3}

    # Check invite links
    if "discord.gg/" in message_content:
        return {"violation_detected": True, "violation_type": "server_invite", "severity": 7}

    return {"violation_detected": False}
```

**Real-Time Monitoring**:
```python
async def monitor_channels_for_violations(bot, channel_ids):
    """
    Monitor specified channels for rule violations.

    Runs as background task, scanning new messages.
    """
    while True:
        for channel_id in channel_ids:
            channel = bot.get_channel(channel_id)
            async for message in channel.history(limit=10):
                violation = await detect_prohibited_patterns(message.content)

                if violation["violation_detected"]:
                    # Auto-delete message
                    await message.delete()

                    # Warn user
                    await warn_user(message.guild, message.author,
                                    f"Violated {violation['violation_type']} rule")

                    # Log to moderation_logs
                    await db_create("moderation_logs", {
                        "guild_id": message.guild.id,
                        "moderator_id": bot.user.id,  # Bot as moderator
                        "target_id": message.author.id,

### 4. Economy System

**Purpose**: Gamify server participation with virtual currency.

#### 4.1 Currency Management

**From database schema - Economy Domain (4 tables)**:
```
player_wallets: Track currency balances
transaction_logs: Audit trail for all transactions
currency_fluctuations: Economy health metrics
item_value_history: Price tracking for marketplace
```

**Core Operations** (from economy_helper):
```python
# Get balance
balance = await get_user_balance(user_id)  # Returns: 1500

# Earn currency (daily login)
await update_user_balance(user_id, +100)
await record_transaction(user_id, +100, "Daily login reward")

# Spend currency (buy card pack)
if balance >= 500:
    await update_user_balance(user_id, -500)
    await record_transaction(user_id, -500, "Purchased Premium Card Pack")
    await grant_card_pack(user_id)
```

**Earning Methods**:
- Daily login reward: +100 currency
- Winning duels: +50-200 (based on opponent's ELO)
- Custom card approval: +500 (incentivize quality submissions)
- Event participation: +250
- Tournament prizes: +1000-5000

**Spending Methods**:
- Card packs: 500 currency (random cards)
- Deck slots: 200 currency (additional deck storage)
- Custom card slots: 1000 currency (submit more than default 3)
- Clan creation: 5000 currency

#### 4.2 Marketplace

**From database schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE card_marketplace (
    listing_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    seller_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    card_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL  -- 'available', 'sold', 'removed'
);
```

**User Workflow**:
```
User A: /sell_card Blue-Eyes price=300

Bot: üì¶ Card listed for sale!
     Card: Blue-Eyes White Dragon
     Price: 300 currency
     Listing ID: #789
