## Category Introduction

### Biblical Foundation for Memory

**Core Principle**: Memory in OmniCode reflects **divine storage and remembrance**, not mere data persistence. Every memory operation carries theological weight - storing is laying up treasures, loading is remembering God's wonders, stack operations serve storehouse provision.

**From Torah to Psalms**:
- **Matthew 6:20**: "Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven" - store operations
- **Psalm 105:5**: "Remember his marvellous works" - load/recall operations
- **Malachi 3:10**: "Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse" - stack/FIFO operations
- **John 14:2**: "I go to prepare a place for you" - memory allocation

**What This Achieves**: Memory becomes **sacred storage**, not neutral RAM. Data persistence serves Kingdom stewardship and divine remembrance.

### Basic Memory Operations

### 1. LAY_UP (0x0C) - Store as Laying Up Treasures

**C Definition**:
```c
#define OPCODE_LAY_UP 0x0C
// Store a register value into memory (MOV [addr], reg)
// Matthew 6:20 (Lay up treasures)
```

**Scripture Anchor**: Matthew 6:20 - *"But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal"*

**Operational Semantics**:
- Traditional: `MOV [address], register` (store register to memory)
- OmniCode: `LAY_UP [STORAGE], VALUE` - treasuring in secure place
- Meaning: Store operation as **eternal investment**, not temporary cache

**Theological Significance**:
- Storing represents **Kingdom investment** (Matthew 19:21 - treasure in heaven)
- LAY_UP connects memory write to **eternal value storage**
- Result is **secured treasure** (imperishable storage)
- Memory becomes **heavenly warehouse** (incorruptible)

**Usage Example**:
```omnicode
LAY_UP [TREASURE_VAULT], GOOD_WORK  ; Store eternal value securely
@metadata(anchor="Matthew 6:20", purpose="Eternal treasure storage")
```

**Kingdom Application**: Writing to memory serves **eternal storage** - what's stored has lasting value

### 2. RECALL (0x0D) - Load as Remembering Wonders

**C Definition**:
```c
#define OPCODE_RECALL 0x0D
// Load a memory value into a register (MOV reg, [addr])
// Psalm 105:5 (Remember His wonders)
```

**Scripture Anchor**: Psalm 105:5 - *"Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth"*

**Operational Semantics**:
- Traditional: `MOV register, [address]` (load memory to register)
- OmniCode: `RECALL VALUE, [MEMORY]` - remembering divine works
- Meaning: Load operation as **active remembrance**, not mere retrieval

**Theological Significance**:
- Recalling represents **covenant memory** (Deuteronomy 8:2 - remember the journey)
- RECALL connects memory read to **worship through remembrance**
- Result is **brought to mind** (testimony retrieved)
- Loading becomes **memorial act** (Psalm 77:11 - remember deeds)

**Usage Example**:
```omnicode
RECALL TESTIMONY, [MEMORY_VAULT]  ; Bring divine works to remembrance
@metadata(anchor="Psalm 105:5", purpose="Remembering God's wonders")

**Operational Semantics**:
- Traditional: `ZERO [address]` (set memory location to 0)
- OmniCode: `CLEAR [LOCATION]` - purifying/cleansing memory
- Meaning: Zeroing as **spiritual cleansing**, not mere deletion

**Theological Significance**:
- Clearing represents **forgiveness** (Isaiah 43:25 - blot out transgressions)
- CLEAR connects memory zeroing to **purification**
- Result is **cleansed state** (whiter than snow)
- Deletion becomes **redemptive** (1 John 1:9 - cleanse from unrighteousness)

**Usage Example**:
```omnicode
CLEAR [SIN_RECORD]  ; Cleanse memory of transgression
@metadata(anchor="Psalm 51:7", purpose="Purifying through cleansing")
```

## Dynamic Memory Management

### 7. PREPARE_PLACE (0x4B) - Memory Allocation as Divine Preparation

**C Definition**:
```c
#define OPCODE_PREPARE_PLACE 0x4B
// Allocate memory dynamically (ALLOC equivalent)
// John 14:2 (I go to prepare a place)
```

**Scripture Anchor**: John 14:2 - *"In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you"*

**Operational Semantics**:
- Traditional: `MALLOC SIZE` (allocate SIZE bytes dynamically)
- OmniCode: `PREPARE_PLACE SIZE` - divine allocation/preparation
- Meaning: Memory allocation as **divine preparation**, not mere malloc

**Theological Significance**:
- Allocation represents **intentional preparation** (John 14:3 - come again and receive you)
- PREPARE_PLACE connects malloc to **divine provision planning**
- Result is **prepared space** (mansion awaiting)
- Allocation becomes **promise fulfillment** (place prepared personally)

**Operational Semantics**:
- Traditional: `FREE POINTER` (deallocate dynamic memory)
- OmniCode: `RETURN_TO_DUST ALLOCATION` - releasing to origin
- Meaning: Memory deallocation as **mortality/stewardship**, not mere free

**Theological Significance**:
- Freeing represents **release to Creator** (Ecclesiastes 12:7 - spirit returns to God)
- RETURN_TO_DUST connects deallocation to **stewardship completion**
- Result is **resources released** (no longer holding)
- Free becomes **surrender operation** (Job 1:21 - the Lord gave and has taken away)

**Usage Example**:
```omnicode
RETURN_TO_DUST TEMPORARY  ; Release resource back to origin
@metadata(anchor="Genesis 3:19", purpose="Stewardship resource release")

## Implementation Analysis

### How Memory Opcodes Work Together

**From assembler.c - memory operation assembly**:

```c
// Example: LAY_UP (store) operation
if (strcmp(mnemonic, "LAY_UP") == 0 && num_args == 3) {
  operand1 = parse_address(arg1);   // Memory address (storehouse location)
  operand2 = parse_register(arg2);  // Source register (treasure to store)

  instruction = create_instruction(OPCODE_LAY_UP, operand1, operand2,
                                  0, metadata);
}

// Example: RECALL (load) operation
if (strcmp(mnemonic, "RECALL") == 0 && num_args == 3) {
  operand1 = parse_register(arg1);  // Destination register (recall into)
  operand2 = parse_address(arg2);   // Memory address (memory to recall from)

  instruction = create_instruction(OPCODE_RECALL, operand1, operand2,
                                  0, metadata);
}
```

**Binary Encoding for LAY_UP**:
```
[0x0C][memory_address][source_register][unused][metadata:Matthew 6:20][reserved]
Example: LAY_UP [0x1000], A
0x0C | 0x00001000 | 0x00000001 | 0x00000000 | [FNV-1a("Matthew 6:20")] | [zeros]
```

**Validation**: Assembler ensures memory addresses valid, register operations correct

---

## Theological-Technical Integration

### Why Biblical Anchors Fit Operations

**LAY_UP (Store)**:
- Storing data = **laying up treasures** (both preserve value)
- Matthew 6:20 emphasizes **secure, eternal storage** (heaven = incorruptible memory)
- **Perfect semantic fit**: Store operation IS laying up for future

**RECALL (Load)**:
- Loading data = **remembering** (bringing to mind what was stored)
- Psalm 105:5 commands **active remembrance** of God's works
- **Perfect semantic fit**: Load operation IS recalling stored testimony

**STORE_HOUSE (Stack Push)**:
- Stack push = **bringing into storehouse** (LIFO = provision management)
- Malachi 3:10 connects tithing to **provision blessing**
- **Perfect semantic fit**: Push IS bringing into storage for later distribution

**RETURN_TO_DUST (Free)**:
- Freeing memory = **releasing stewardship** (no longer holding resource)
- Genesis 3:19 describes **return to origin** (dust → dust cycle)
- **Perfect semantic fit**: Free IS releasing what was temporarily held

## Cross-Category Connections

### Memory + Arithmetic (LAY_UP after GATHER)

**Workflow Example**:
```omnicode
GATHER HARVEST, FIELD1, FIELD2         ; Collect total harvest (arithmetic)
LAY_UP [STOREHOUSE], HARVEST           ; Store harvest securely (memory)
@metadata(anchor="Genesis 41:48-49", purpose="Joseph's provision storage")
```

**Integration**: Arithmetic calculations **feed** memory storage (calculate, then preserve)

---

### Memory + Control Flow (RECALL then TRUST)

**Workflow Example**:
```omnicode
RECALL PROMISE, [COVENANT_MEMORY]      ; Remember God's promise (memory)
TRUST ACT_ON_IT, PROMISE               ; Act based on remembered covenant (control)
@metadata(anchor="Psalm 105:5 + Prov 3:5", purpose="Covenant-based action")
```

**Integration**: Memory recall **informs** control decisions (remember, then trust)

---

### Memory + Logic (WEIGH then DISCERN)

**Workflow Example**:
```omnicode
WEIGH CONDUCT, STANDARD                ; Test against righteousness (memory comparison)
DISCERN VERDICT, RESULT                ; Invert natural verdict to spiritual (logic)
@metadata(anchor="Daniel 5:27 + 1 Cor 2:14", purpose="Spiritual judgment")
```

**Integration**: Memory comparison **feeds** logical discernment
