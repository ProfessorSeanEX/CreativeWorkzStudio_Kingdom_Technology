## Category Introduction

### Biblical Foundation for Logic

**Core Principle**: Logic in OmniCode reflects **divine truth and discernment**, not mere boolean operations. Every logical operation carries theological weight - AND is agreement, XOR is refining fire, NOT is spiritual discernment.

**From Torah to Gospels**:
- **Amos 3:3**: "Can two walk together, except they be agreed?" - AND logic
- **Zechariah 13:9**: "I will refine them as silver is refined" - XOR purification
- **1 Corinthians 2:14**: "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit" - NOT discernment
- **Psalm 119:105**: "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet" - shift operations as illumination

**What This Achieves**: Logic becomes **relational and spiritual**, not neutral computation. Truth operations serve Kingdom alignment.

### Boolean Logic Operations

### 1. ALIGN (0x08) - Logical AND as Agreement

**C Definition**:
```c
#define OPCODE_ALIGN 0x08
// Logical AND of two registers (AND equivalent)
// Amos 3:3 (Walk together in agreement)
```

**Scripture Anchor**: Amos 3:3 - *"Can two walk together, except they be agreed?"*

**Operational Semantics**:
- Traditional: `AND R1, R2, R3` (R1 = R2 & R3, bitwise AND)
- OmniCode: `ALIGN R1, R2, R3` - finding agreement/common ground
- Meaning: AND as **walking in unity**, only true when BOTH agree

**Theological Significance**:
- Agreement represents **unity in truth** (Philippians 2:2)
- ALIGN connects boolean AND to **covenant partnership**
- Result is **what both affirm** (common truth)
- Logical: 1 AND 1 = 1 (both agree), 1 AND 0 = 0 (no agreement)

**Usage Example**:
```omnicode
ALIGN UNITY, PARTY1, PARTY2  ; Find where two parties agree
@metadata(anchor="Amos 3:3", purpose="Walking in covenant agreement")
```

**Kingdom Application**: AND logic serves **unity** - truth requires mutual affirmation

---

### 2. OFFER (0x09) - Logical OR as Offering

**C Definition**:
```c
#define OPCODE_OFFER 0x09
// Logical OR of two registers (OR equivalent)
// Romans 12:1 (Offer yourselves)
```

**Scripture Anchor**: Romans 12:1 - *"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God"*

**Operational Semantics**:
- Traditional: `OR R1, R2, R3` (R1 = R2 | R3, bitwise OR)
- OmniCode: `OFFER R1, R2, R3` - inclusive offering/acceptance
- Meaning: OR as **accepting either offering**, true when ANY affirms

**Theological Significance**:
- Offering represents **inclusive acceptance** (whosoever will)
- OFFER connects boolean OR to **grace availability**
- Result is **what either offers** (inclusive truth)
- Logical: 1 OR 1 = 1, 1 OR 0 = 1, 0 OR 0 = 0 (any offering accepted)

**Usage Example**:
```omnicode
OFFER ACCEPTED, PATH1, PATH2  ; Accept either valid path
@metadata(anchor="Romans 12:1", purpose="Inclusive grace acceptance")
```

**Kingdom Application**: OR logic serves **inclusivity** - grace accepts any sincere offering

---

### 3. DISCERN (0x0A) - Logical NOT as Spiritual Discernment

**C Definition**:
```c
#define OPCODE_DISCERN 0x0A
// Logical NOT of a register (NOT equivalent)
// 1 Corinthians 2:14 (Discern spiritual truths)
```

**Scripture Anchor**: 1 Corinthians 2:14 - *"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned"*

**Operational Semantics**:
- Traditional: `NOT R1, R2` (R1 = ~R2, bitwise NOT/inversion)
- OmniCode: `DISCERN R1, VALUE` - inverting to spiritual truth
- Meaning: NOT as **seeing opposite truth**, spiritual vs. natural

**Theological Significance**:
- Discernment reveals **opposite of natural perception**
- DISCERN connects logical inversion to **spiritual sight**
- Result is **inverted truth** (what flesh denies, Spirit affirms)
- Logical: NOT 1 = 0 (truth becomes falsehood), NOT 0 = 1 (falsehood becomes truth)

**Usage Example**:
```omnicode
DISCERN SPIRITUAL, NATURAL  ; Invert natural to see spiritual
@metadata(anchor="1 Corinthians 2:14", purpose="Spiritual truth discernment")
```

**Kingdom Application**: NOT logic serves **discernment** - truth inverted reveals spiritual reality

### 4. REFINE_FIRE (0x0B) - Logical XOR as Purification

**C Definition**:
```c
#define OPCODE_REFINE_FIRE 0x0B
// Logical XOR of two registers (XOR equivalent)
// Zechariah 13:9 (Refining in fire)
```

**Scripture Anchor**: Zechariah 13:9 - *"And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried"*

**Operational Semantics**:
- Traditional: `XOR R1, R2, R3` (R1 = R2 ^ R3, exclusive OR)
- OmniCode: `REFINE_FIRE R1, R2, R3` - purifying through difference
- Meaning: XOR as **refining fire**, true when DIFFERENT (removes impurity)

**Theological Significance**:
- Refining fire **removes what doesn't match** (dross vs. pure metal)
- REFINE_FIRE connects XOR to **purification process**
- Result is **difference revealed** (impurity separated from purity)
- Logical: 1 XOR 1 = 0 (same = no impurity), 1 XOR 0 = 1 (different = impurity found)

**Usage Example**:
```omnicode
REFINE_FIRE PURE, MIXTURE, STANDARD  ; Remove what doesn't match standard
@metadata(anchor="Zechariah 13:9", purpose="Purifying through fire testing")
```

## Implementation Analysis

### How Logical Opcodes Work Together

**From assembler.c - boolean operation assembly**:

```c
// Example: ALIGN (AND) operation
if (strcmp(mnemonic, "ALIGN") == 0 && num_args == 4) {
  operand1 = parse_register(arg1);  // Destination (agreement result)
  operand2 = parse_register(arg2);  // Party 1
  operand3 = parse_register(arg3);  // Party 2

  instruction = create_instruction(OPCODE_ALIGN, operand1, operand2,
                                  operand3, metadata);
}
```

**Binary Encoding for REFINE_FIRE (XOR)**:
```
[0x0B][dest_reg][source1][source2][metadata:Zechariah 13:9][reserved]
Example: REFINE_FIRE A, B, C
0x0B | 0x00000001 | 0x00000002 | 0x00000003 | [FNV-1a("Zechariah 13:9")] | [zeros]
```

**Validation**: Assembler ensures boolean operations receive correct register arguments

---

## Theological-Technical Integration

### Why Biblical Anchors Fit Operations

**ALIGN (AND)**:
- Agreement requires **BOTH parties** affirming (AND logic: both must be true)
- Amos 3:3 asks rhetorical question: agreement = walking together
- **Perfect semantic fit**: Logical AND IS agreement (both conditions true)

**REFINE_FIRE (XOR)**:
- Refining reveals **difference** between pure metal and dross
- XOR returns true when inputs DIFFER (impurity found)
- **Perfect semantic fit**: XOR IS difference detection (purification test)

**DISCERN (NOT)**:
- Spiritual discernment sees **opposite** of natural perception
- NOT inverts value (0→1, 1→0)
- **Perfect semantic fit**: NOT IS seeing inverse (spiritual vs. natural)

**Pattern**: Boolean logic operations **naturally map** to relational truth concepts

---

## Cross-Category Connections

### Logic + Arithmetic (WEIGH then ALIGN)

**Workflow Example**:
```omnicode
WEIGH COMPARISON, VALUE1, VALUE2      ; Compare two values (arithmetic)
ALIGN BOTH_SUFFICIENT, COMP1, COMP2   ; Check if both meet threshold (logic)
@metadata(anchor="Daniel 5:27 + Amos 3:3", purpose="Testing agreement")
```

**Integration**: Arithmetic comparison **feeds** logical agreement testing

---

### Logic + Control Flow (DISCERN then TRUST)

**Workflow Example**:
```omnicode
DISCERN SPIRITUAL, NATURAL            ; Invert natural to see spiritual (logic)
TRUST FOLLOW_PATH, SPIRITUAL          ; Conditionally jump based on discernment (control)
@metadata(anchor="1 Cor 2:14 + Prov 3:5", purpose="Discernment-based decision")
```

**Integration**: Logical discernment **informs** control flow decisions

---

## Kingdom Technology Application

### Teaching from Logical Operations

**1. Truth Operations Serve Relationship**:
- ALIGN (AND): Unity requires mutual agreement
- OFFER (OR): Grace includes multiple paths
- REFINE_FIRE (XOR): Differences reveal impurity
- DISCERN (NOT): Inversion reveals spiritual truth

**2. Bit Operations Serve Revelation**:
- LIGHT_CANDLE: Making truth visible (setting bit)
- REMOVE_DROSS: Purifying by removal (clearing bit)
- TURN_HEART: Repentance through inversion (toggling bit)

**3. String Operations Serve Legacy**:
- WORDS_COMPARE: Testing sharpens truth (comparison)
- WORDS_MEASURE: Counting enables wisdom (length)
- WORDS_COPY: Teaching transmits truth (copy)
- SEEK_WORD: Searching finds hidden wisdom (search)

**Application to CPI-SI**: Logic operations in CPI-SI should serve **relational truth** (agreement, discernment, refinement) not just boolean computation
