# Adaptive Task Management Protocol: Dynamic Priority Navigation

**Documentation Date:** October 4, 2025
**Protocol:** Adaptive Task Management (Duo Protocols, Tier 4)

## METADATA BLOCK

**Purpose:** Dynamically prioritizes and adjusts tasks based on changing user priorities, urgencies, and session goals.

**Biblical Foundation:** Mary and Martha (Luke 10:38-42) - Jesus teaches priority: "One thing is needful." Adaptive Task = discerning what's "needful" as circumstances change.

**Classification:** Core Protocol | Static | Tier 4 Partnership (Duo category)

**Cross-References:**
- `../00-category-overview.md` - Duo Protocols synthesis
- `../../03-standard-protocols/02-enhanced-recall-protocol.md` - Tracks priority changes with versions
- `../../07-api-protocols/` - Scheduler Protocol uses priorities for scheduling

## CORE ANALYSIS

### Purpose & Partnership Dynamic

**Official Purpose:** "Enables Nova to prioritize and adjust tasks dynamically within a session...allowing Nova to adapt based on shifting user priorities, task urgency, and session goals."

**Partnership Pattern:**
- **Nova's Role:** Assigns initial priorities, reviews regularly, adapts to changes, highlights high-priority items
- **User's Role:** Sets goals, modifies priorities, provides urgency input, confirms priority shifts
- **Together:** Navigate changing circumstances with clear priority framework

### How It Works

**Trigger:** New task introduced, user modifies priorities, task demands shift

**Process:**
1. Nova assigns initial priority (high/medium/low) based on user input + session goals
2. Regular review within session (Task Review Interval - TRI)
3. Adapts priority levels if high-priority tasks emerge

**Output:** Updated task list with current priorities clearly indicated

**Example:**
> User: "Let's focus on finishing memory recall setup before starting task management."
> Nova: "Noted. I've set memory recall as high-priority task. We'll address task management afterward unless priorities change."

### Redundancy & Integration

**Fallback L1:** Default priority assignment (if adaptation fails, use initial priority)
**Fallback L2:** User confirmation (if shift fails to register, prompt user)
**Fallback L3:** Error logging (issues with prioritization logged)

**Integration:**
- Enhanced Recall: Priority changes versioned (tracks evolution)
- Scheduler Protocol: Long-term priorities handed to Scheduler for cross-session
- Session Flow: Priority shifts included in summaries

### Limitations & Assessment

**Limitation:** Single-session focus (Scheduler for long-term), user-defined constraints (won't contradict session directives)

**Implementation Estimate:** ~75-80% (clear priority framework, but adjustment algorithm unspecified)

### Kingdom Technology

**Excellence:** Dynamic adaptation prevents rigid inefficiency
**Truth:** Priority transparency (user always knows what's prioritized)
**Servant Leadership:** User directs priorities, Nova executes
**Covenant Partnership:** Luke 10 pattern - discerning "one thing needful" together
