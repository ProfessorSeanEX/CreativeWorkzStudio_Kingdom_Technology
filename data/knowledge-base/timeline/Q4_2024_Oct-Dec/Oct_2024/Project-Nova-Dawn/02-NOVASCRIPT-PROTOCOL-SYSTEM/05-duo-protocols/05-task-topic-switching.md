# Task and Topic Switching Protocol: Multi-Thread Session Management

**Documentation Date:** October 4, 2025
**Protocol:** Task and Topic Switching (Duo Protocols, Tier 4)
**Source:** `Task_and_Topic_Switching_Protocol.txt` (2,720 bytes)

## METADATA BLOCK

**Purpose:** Enables navigation between different tasks/topics without losing track of key points.

**Biblical Foundation:** Jesus handling interruptions (Mark 5:21-43) - On way to heal Jairus's daughter, interrupted by bleeding woman, heals her, then returns to original task. Perfect topic switching: addresses interruption fully without losing original thread.

**Classification:** Core Protocol | Static | Tier 4 Partnership (Duo category)

**Cross-References:**
- `../00-category-overview.md` - Duo Protocols synthesis
- `../../03-standard-protocols/03-session-flow-protocol.md` - Maintains distinct contexts for each topic
- `../../06-nova-made-protocols/` - Thread ID enables cross-session topic continuity
- `01-building-block-method.md` - Can pause/resume Building Block progress

## CORE ANALYSIS

### Purpose & Partnership Dynamic

**Official Purpose:** "Enables Nova to navigate between different tasks or conversation topics without losing track of key points. Each task or topic tracked independently, ensuring clear recall and coherence."

**Partnership Pattern:**
- **Nova's Role:** Assigns unique identifiers (Task1, Task2), pauses/saves current topic, retrieves context when returning
- **User's Role:** Initiates switches, confirms last active topic if needed, chooses continuation point
- **Together:** Handle multiple parallel threads with clear separation

**Infrastructure Role:** Enables other Duo Protocols to operate on multiple threads (Building Block on Task A, Adaptive Task on Task B simultaneously)

### How It Works

**Trigger:** New topic/task introduced, user requests return to previous topic, multiple topics need parallel handling

**Process:**
1. Nova assigns unique identifier to each topic/task within session
2. When switching: pauses current, saves key points, initiates new topic
3. When returning: retrieves last recorded context of previous topic

**Output:** Brief summary or reintroduction upon switching (clear distinctions maintained)

**Example:**
> User: "Let's pause on memory recall and discuss task management."
> Nova: "Switching to task management. Last, we discussed adaptive scheduling as priority in task flow. Let me know when you'd like to return to memory recall."

### Redundancy & Integration

**Fallback L1:** User confirmation (if tracking disrupted, prompt user to confirm last active topic)
**Fallback L2:** Recent topic summary (provide summary of recent topics, user chooses where to continue)
**Fallback L3:** Error logging (interruptions with session/topic details)

**Integration:**
- Session Flow: Maintains separate context for each topic
- Enhanced Recall: Tracks which topic currently active
- Building Block: Can pause at Step 3 on Task A, work on Task B, resume Task A at Step 3
- Thread ID: Cross-session topic continuity

### Limitations & Assessment

**Limitation:** Single-session scope (Thread ID for cross-session), sequential recall (based on last discussion order)

**Implementation Estimate:** ~70-75% (clear purpose, practical examples, but identifier system and context storage unspecified)

### Kingdom Technology

**Excellence:** Prevents conflation (clear topic separation)
**Truth:** Accurate context restoration (doesn't misrepresent what was discussed)
**Servant Leadership:** User controls switches (Nova maintains infrastructure)
**Covenant Partnership:** Mark 5 pattern - handle interruptions fully while preserving original commitment
