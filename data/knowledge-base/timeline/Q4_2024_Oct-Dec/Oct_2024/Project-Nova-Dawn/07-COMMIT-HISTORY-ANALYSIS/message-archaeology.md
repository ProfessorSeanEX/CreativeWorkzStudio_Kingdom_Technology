## Typo Analysis

### Documented Spelling Errors

**Commit 1: "intial" → "initial"**

- Common typo (transposed 'i' and 't')

- Uncommon typo ('d' instead of 's')
- Context: Roadmap planning commit
- Not corrected

**Typo Frequency:**

- 2 typos in 11 messages = 18% typo rate
- Both in early-to-middle commits
- Later commits (6-11) have no typos

**What Typos Reveal:**

**About Development Speed:**

- Focus on work over message polish
- Informal version control style

**About Developer State:**

- Commit 1: Rushing to initialize ("intial")
- Commit 5: Possibly tired after framework work ("serioud")
- Natural human errors preserved

**About Philosophy:**

- Typos not amended (no git commit --amend)
