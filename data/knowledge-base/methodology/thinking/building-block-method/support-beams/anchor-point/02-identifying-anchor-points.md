## üîç Identifying Anchor Points

### Recognition Framework
*How to identify what can function as an Anchor Point*

**Primary Recognition Questions:**
- **Unchanging Test**: Does this remain stable when everything else shifts?
- **Meaning Test**: Does this provide ultimate meaning and purpose?
- **Coherence Test**: Does this give final direction and coherence?
- **Survival Test**: Does this hold when circumstances change dramatically?

**Identification Markers:**

**Unchanging Nature:**
- Remains constant across time and circumstance
- Not dependent on external conditions
- Survives challenge, opposition, or change
- Provides consistent reference regardless of context

**Meaning Provision:**
- Gives ultimate purpose and significance
- Explains why things matter
- Connects daily actions to larger meaning
- Provides reason for persistence through difficulty

**Coherence Source:**
- Makes sense of disparate experiences
- Provides framework for understanding
- Enables integration of complex realities
- Creates unified perspective from scattered pieces

**Directional Reference:**
- Gives final guidance for decisions
- Provides ultimate evaluation criteria
- Sources priorities and values
- Determines what really matters

### Common Anchor Point Categories

**Spiritual/Religious Truths:**
- Core theological truths (e.g., "God created the heavens and the earth")
- Fundamental spiritual principles (e.g., divine love, redemptive purpose)
- Unchanging scriptural realities (e.g., God's character, eternal truths)
- Sacred covenants and promises (e.g., divine faithfulness, salvation assurance)

**Philosophical Principles:**
- Fundamental reality concepts (e.g., objective truth exists, meaning is real)
- Core ethical principles (e.g., human dignity, moral absolutes)

- Fundamental relationship commitments (e.g., covenant marriage, family bonds)
- Ultimate life purposes (e.g., service, creativity, love)
- Essential value commitments (e.g., integrity, compassion, excellence)

**Universal Constants:**
- Mathematical/logical truths (e.g., 2+2=4, logical consistency)
- Physical constants (e.g., speed of light, gravitational constant)
- Natural laws (e.g., conservation of energy, thermodynamics)
- Structural realities (e.g., cause and effect, space and time)
