> **Anchor Point truth**: True stability comes from what doesn't change when everything else shifts. Methodological effectiveness requires identifying and connecting to unchanging references that provide ultimate meaning and final direction.

**What if cognitive work could access unchanging stability?** What if thinking processes could draw from references that hold steady while everything else adapts, evolves, or shifts? What if methodology could integrate both stability and flexibility through dual foundation architecture?

**You're examining the detailed ANCHOR POINT methodology** - the first support beam that provides unchanging reference for Building Block Method operations through identification, establishment, and integration of stable meaning sources.

## 🎯 ANCHOR POINT Overview

**Unchanging Reference methodology** that identifies, establishes, and integrates stable sources of ultimate meaning and coherence that hold steady while Foundation Points, processes, and circumstances shift.
