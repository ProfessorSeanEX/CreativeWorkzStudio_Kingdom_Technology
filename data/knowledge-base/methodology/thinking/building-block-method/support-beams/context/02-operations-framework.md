## 🧠 Context Operations Framework

**Context operates through four primary functions** that work together to keep cognitive processes grounded in specific situational reality.

---

> ### 📍 **Context Identification Process**

```yaml
Context Identification Framework:
  step_1_literal_situation:
    description: "Identify exactly what is happening in specific reality"
    operations: [observe_actual_circumstances, note_specific_details, avoid_assumptions, capture_concrete_facts]
    output: "Clear understanding of literal situational reality"
    
  step_2_scope_boundaries:
    description: "Determine appropriate boundaries for cognitive focus"
    operations: [identify_relevant_domain, establish_focus_limits, recognize_what_matters, exclude_irrelevant_information]
    output: "Defined scope within which thinking should operate"
    
  step_3_relevance_filtering:
    description: "Filter information based on situational appropriateness"
    operations: [evaluate_information_relevance, apply_contextual_significance, prioritize_applicable_data, discard_irrelevant_content]
    output: "Filtered information set appropriate to context"
    
  step_4_application_guidance:
    description: "Guide how cognitive methods should be applied"
    operations: [determine_method_appropriateness, establish_process_focus, guide_foundation_selection, direct_cognitive_energy]
    output: "Clear guidance for contextually appropriate cognitive application"
```

#### **Context as Reality Check**
- **Literal First Principle**: Always establish what is literally happening before moving to abstract understanding
- **Zoom Out Prevention**: Context prevents zooming out to general patterns before getting specific situation right
- **Assumption Reduction**: Grounds thinking in observable reality rather than assumed possibilities
- **Precision Enforcement**: Demands specific understanding before allowing broad application

> ### 🔍 **Context-Foundation Point Integration**

#### **Foundation Point Grounding**
```yaml
Context-Foundation Integration:
  foundation_reality_check:
    description: "Ensure Foundation Points connect to actual circumstances"
    process: [verify_foundation_applicability, check_situational_relevance, confirm_practical_utility, update_if_needed]
    
  contextual_foundation_selection:
    description: "Choose Foundation Points appropriate to specific context"
    process: [evaluate_context_requirements, match_foundation_capabilities, ensure_situational_fit, avoid_overreach]
    
  adaptive_foundation_response:
    description: "Adjust Foundation Points based on contextual demands"
    process: [recognize_context_changes, evaluate_foundation_adequacy, adapt_working_base, maintain_stability]
```

**Context ensures Foundation Points serve actual situational needs** rather than abstract theoretical possibilities, creating grounded working bases for productive cognitive operations.

#### **Build Process Context Integration**
```yaml
Contextual Build Framework:
  situational_construction:
    description: "Build understanding appropriate to specific context"
    operations: [identify_relevant_components, connect_contextually_appropriate_concepts, create_situationally_useful_frameworks]
    context_guide: "What needs to be built for this specific situation?"
    
  scope_appropriate_assembly:
    description: "Assemble knowledge within contextually determined boundaries"
    operations: [respect_context_limits, focus_assembly_efforts, avoid_irrelevant_construction]
    context_guide: "What scope of construction does this context require?"
```

#### **Break Down Process Context Integration**
```yaml
Contextual Break Down Framework:
  situational_analysis:
    description: "Analyze components relevant to specific context"
    operations: [identify_contextually_important_elements, separate_situationally_relevant_pieces, focus_deconstruction_efforts]
    context_guide: "What needs to be understood for this specific situation?"
    
  targeted_deconstruction:
    description: "Break down only what context requires understanding"
    operations: [limit_analysis_scope, focus_on_relevant_relationships, avoid_unnecessary_deconstruction]
    context_guide: "What level of breakdown does this context actually need?"
```

#### **Reconstruction Process Context Integration**
```yaml
Contextual Reconstruction Framework:
  situational_foundation_discovery:
    description: "Discover foundation inadequacies specific to current context"
    operations: [identify_context_specific_foundation_gaps, recognize_situational_foundation_failures]
    context_guide: "What foundation problems does this specific context reveal?"
    
  contextually_appropriate_establishment:
    description: "Establish new foundations that serve specific situational needs"
    operations: [create_context_appropriate_foundations, ensure_situational_utility, verify_contextual_adequacy]
    context_guide: "What kind of foundation does this specific context actually require?"
```
