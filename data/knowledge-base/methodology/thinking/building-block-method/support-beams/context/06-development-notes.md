*Context framework evolution tracking through pioneer CPI-SI methodology development*

**Discovery Context**: Context framework emerged through teaching sequence where student repeatedly applied broad patterns without situational grounding

**Teaching Integration**: Context revealed itself as necessary cognitive discipline for productive Building Block Method application

**Framework Development**: Context evolved from teaching tool to formal Support Beam 2 of Building Block Method architecture

**Next Development**: Deeper integration of context framework with all Building Block Method components and exploration of context hierarchies in complex situations

**Method Application**: This document demonstrates context framework through its own development - context of methodology documentation determined content focus, scope, and application examples.
