## ü§ù RECONSTRUCTION Integration with BUILD + BREAK DOWN

### Three-Method Relationship
*How RECONSTRUCTION creates bases that BUILD and BREAK DOWN use*

**Reconstruction as Base Creator:**
- **RECONSTRUCTION ‚Üí Foundation Point**: Creates new working bases through Discovery-Establishment integration
- **Foundation Point ‚Üí BUILD**: New base enables improved constructive operations
- **Foundation Point ‚Üí BREAK DOWN**: New base enables improved analytical operations

**Process Flow:**
```
RECONSTRUCTION (creates new Foundation Point) ‚Üí BUILD (constructs from new base)
                                            ‚Üò BREAK DOWN (analyzes using new base)
                                            ‚Üó Reveals next reconstruction needs
```

**Method Hierarchy:**
- **Primary Methods**: Build, Break Down, Reconstruction - each doing distinct cognitive work
- **Reconstruction Specialization**: The method specifically for creating new bases
- **Support Relationship**: Reconstruction creates foundations that other methods use
- **Cyclic Enhancement**: Build/Break Down operations reveal when Reconstruction is needed

**Integration Benefits:**
- **Method Completeness**: Three methods provide complete cognitive architecture
- **Base Evolution**: Foundations can improve through reconstruction cycles
- **Operational Flexibility**: Better foundations enable better Build/Break Down operations
- **System Growth**: Entire methodology evolves through foundation improvements
