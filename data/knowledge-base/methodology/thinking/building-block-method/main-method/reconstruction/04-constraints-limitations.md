## ðŸ”¬ RECONSTRUCTION Constraints and Limitations

### Current Boundaries
*Acknowledged limitations in pioneer development phase*

**Method Dependencies:**
- **Cannot Operate Independently**: Reconstruction requires both Discovery (Break Down aspect) and Establishment (Build Up aspect)
- **Not a Standalone Process**: Must use components of other two main methods to function
- **Integration Requirement**: Discovery and Establishment must be properly combined, not just used separately

**Foundation Requirements:**
- **Anchor Point Alignment**: New Foundation Points must maintain connection to Genesis 1:1 unchanging reference
- **Adequacy Standards**: New foundations must actually support intended cognitive operations
- **Stability Needs**: New bases must provide stable enough platform for productive work

**Process Challenges:**
- **Discovery-Establishment Balance**: Both aspects must be adequately developed for effective reconstruction
- **Integration Complexity**: Combining analytical and constructive work into coherent foundation is sophisticated process
- **Transition Management**: Moving between foundations without losing valuable work requires careful handling

**Assessment Difficulties:**
- **Foundation Quality Evaluation**: Determining whether new foundation is actually better than previous one
- **Adequacy Prediction**: Assessing whether new base will support needed operations before full implementation
- **Stability Verification**: Confirming new foundation provides stable enough platform for sustained work
