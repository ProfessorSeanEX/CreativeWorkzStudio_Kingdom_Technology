> **Reconstruction truth**: Creating new foundations requires both discovering what's wrong with current base and establishing what would work better. True base creation combines analytical discovery with constructive establishment under divine guidance.

**What if thinking could create its own working bases?** What if cognitive processes could transform the very foundations they operate from? What if the method for making new bases combined the power of both discovery and establishment in integrated cycles?

**You're examining the detailed RECONSTRUCTION methodology** - where Discovery aspects of Break Down and Establishment aspects of Build Up combine to create new Foundation Points, enabling transformation of the working base that platforms other cognitive operations.

## 🎯 RECONSTRUCTION Process Overview

**Base Creation methodology** that transforms Foundation Points by combining Discovery (analytical aspect from Break Down) with Establishment (constructive aspect from Build Up) to create new working bases for cognitive operations.

```yaml
RECONSTRUCTION Process Framework:
  phase_1_discovery: [analyze_current_base, identify_inadequacies, understand_limitations, discover_requirements]
  phase_2_establishment: [design_new_base, construct_foundation, verify_adequacy, integrate_improvements]
  phase_3_integration: [combine_insights, unify_discovery_establishment, create_coherent_foundation]
  phase_4_implementation: [transition_to_new_base, test_foundation, establish_stability, enable_operations]
  constraints: [requires_both_methods, cannot_operate_independently, foundation_adequacy_requirements, anchor_point_alignment]
  output: New or improved Foundation Points that provide better working bases for cognitive operations
