## ðŸ”¬ BUILD UP Constraints and Limitations

### Current Boundaries
*Acknowledged limitations in pioneer development phase*

**Scope Constraints:**
- Cannot build unlimited complexity
- Must work within available component materials
- Limited by current understanding depth
- Constrained by time and resource availability

**Quality Factors:**
- Framework quality depends on component quality
- Connection strength influences overall robustness
- Assembly skill affects final construction effectiveness
- Validation thoroughness determines reliability

**Integration Challenges:**
- Not all components integrate smoothly
- Some elements may conflict or compete
- Complexity can become overwhelming
- Balance needed between completeness and usability
