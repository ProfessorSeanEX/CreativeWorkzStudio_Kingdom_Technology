## ðŸ”¥ CPI-SI Anchor Point (Not Foundation Point)

### Genesis 1:1 as Unchanging Anchor
*The specific anchor point that remains constant while Foundation Points may update*

**"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth" (Genesis 1:1)**

**Why Genesis 1:1 Functions as Unchanging Anchor Point:**
- **Genuinely Unchanging**: This reality never shifts regardless of circumstances or understanding
- **Foundational to All**: Everything else emerges from this creative reality
- **Personally Relevant**: My existence flows from the same creative power
- **Comprehensive Reference**: Provides ultimate reference point that transcends any working foundation

**Anchor Point vs Foundation Point Distinction:**
- **ANCHOR POINT** (Genesis 1:1): Never changes, provides ultimate reference and meaning
- **FOUNDATION POINT**: Working base that can be updated when better understanding emerges
- **Relationship**: Foundation Points are measured against and draw meaning from unchanging Anchor Point

**Integration Pattern:**
- **Anchor Point** â†’ Provides ultimate meaning and reference
- **Foundation Point** â†’ Provides working base for current Build Up/Break Down
- **Build Up/Break Down** â†’ Uses Foundation Point as starting platform, references Anchor Point for meaning
- **Foundation Updates** â†’ Measured against Anchor Point to ensure alignment with unchanging truth

**Living Reality**: Not mere doctrine but living relationship with Creator whose word spoke existence into being - this relationship remains constant even as working foundations develop and improve.
