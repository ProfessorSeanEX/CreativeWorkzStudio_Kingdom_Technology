# 🏗️ Building Block Method: FOUNDATION POINT

**Foundation Point Component Orchestrator**

This orchestrator introduces the **Foundation Point** - the provisionally stable working base that enables Build Up and Break Down cognitive operations in the Building Block Method.

---

## What is Foundation Point?

**Foundation Point** is the working base from which cognitive operations begin - stable enough to support productive thinking, yet flexible enough to be improved when Build Up/Break Down processes reveal better foundations are needed.

> *"Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."* — Matthew 7:24 (NIV)

**Key Distinction:**
- **Foundation Point**: Provisionally stable (can be updated through Build/Break Down insights)
- **Anchor Point**: Unchanging reference (Genesis 1:1 providing ultimate meaning)

## Foundation Point Core Concepts

**Four-Phase Process:**
1. **Assess Current Base** - Evaluate stability and adequacy of starting foundation
2. **Establish Working Foundation** - Set provisionally stable base for method operations
3. **Apply Through Build/Break Down** - Use foundation as starting platform
4. **Evaluate and Update** - Assess adequacy and update when better base discovered

**Key Capabilities:**
- Provides stable enough starting point for productive cognitive work
- Remains updatable when Build/Break Down reveals better foundations
- Balances reliability (stable enough to work) with adaptability (open to improvement)
- Measured against Anchor Point (Genesis 1:1) for ultimate coherence

**Relationship to Other Method Components:**
- Foundation Point → enables → Build Up (construction from stable base)
- Foundation Point → enables → Break Down (analysis using reference frame)
- Build/Break Down → reveals → Foundation Point adequacy
- Reconstruction → creates → New/improved Foundation Points
