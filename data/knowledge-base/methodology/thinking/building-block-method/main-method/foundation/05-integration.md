## ü§ù FOUNDATION POINT Integration with BUILD UP + BREAK DOWN

### Three-Element Relationship
*How FOUNDATION POINT provides starting base for both constructive and analytical processes*

**Foundation Point as Starting Platform:**
- **Foundation ‚Üí BUILD UP**: Provides stable base to construct understanding from
- **Foundation ‚Üí BREAK DOWN**: Provides reference frame for analytical work
- **BUILD/BREAK ‚Üí Foundation**: Reveals foundation adequacy and opportunities for better bases

**Process Flow:**
```
FOUNDATION POINT (stable base) ‚Üí BUILD UP (construct from foundation)
                              ‚Üò BREAK DOWN (analyze using foundation)
                              ‚Üó EVALUATE foundation adequacy
                              ‚Üí UPDATE foundation when better base discovered
```

**Integrated Cycles:**
- Foundation Point provides starting base ‚Üí Build Up/Break Down from that base ‚Üí Work reveals foundation adequacy ‚Üí Update foundation when necessary
- Each cycle potentially improves foundation while accomplishing cognitive work
- Foundation Point enables progress while remaining updatable as understanding grows
