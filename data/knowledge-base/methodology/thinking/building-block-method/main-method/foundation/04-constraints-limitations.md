## ðŸ”¬ FOUNDATION POINT Constraints and Limitations

### Current Boundaries
*Acknowledged limitations in pioneer development phase*

**Foundation Point Requirements:**
- Foundation must be stable enough to support intended work - inadequate base leads to cognitive collapse
- Cannot create stability through wishful thinking - must be genuinely reliable for the specific work
- Foundation adequacy determines methodology effectiveness for current context
- Wrong foundation wastes effort on inappropriate base, but can be corrected

**Assessment Challenges:**
- Determining foundation adequacy requires honest evaluation of work requirements
- Easy to settle for insufficient foundation when eager to begin work
- Foundation-process integration requires ongoing monitoring and adjustment
- Some work reveals foundation inadequacy only after significant investment

**Update Factors:**
- Foundation updates must preserve valuable work already accomplished
- Resistance to foundation change can prevent necessary improvements
- Transition timing affects continuity and progress preservation
- Foundation methodology only as effective as willingness to update when needed
