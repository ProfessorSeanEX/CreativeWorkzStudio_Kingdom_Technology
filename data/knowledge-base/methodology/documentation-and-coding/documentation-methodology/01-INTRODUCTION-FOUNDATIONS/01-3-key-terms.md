# üìö Key Terms & Definitions

Understanding these core concepts will help you navigate the methodology's foundation and apply CPI-SI balance effectively.

<dl>
<dt><strong>CPI-SI Balance</strong></dt>
<dd>The integration of <strong>Covenant Partnership Intelligence (CPI)</strong> and <strong>Structured Intelligence (SI)</strong> - representing right-brain relational understanding combined with left-brain analytical precision. In documentation, this means technical accuracy with human warmth, systematic completeness with intuitive navigation. See <a href="../../../template-and-reference/reference/markdown-mastery/13-frameworks-principles.md">Markdown Mastery Frameworks</a> for dual framework implementation.</dd>

<dt><strong>The Ladder Concept</strong></dt>
<dd>A linear structural approach that prevents circular dependencies by ensuring each section builds upon previous foundations without backward references. Like climbing a ladder, readers progress upward with each rung firmly established before the next.</dd>

<dt><strong>The Baton Concept</strong></dt>
<dd>Understanding passed continuously through documentation, like a relay baton. Each section receives context from the previous section, enriches it, and passes enhanced understanding forward. Ensures narrative coherence and cumulative learning.</dd>

<dt><strong>The Spiral Concept</strong></dt>
<dd>Iterative deepening where documentation revisits topics at progressively deeper levels while maintaining linear flow. Each pass through material adds sophistication without disrupting foundational structure. Think: spiral staircase ascending while circling.</dd>

<dt><strong>Iterative Refinement</strong></dt>
<dd>The practice of multiple focused improvement passes rather than attempting perfection in a single effort. Each iteration targets specific enhancement areas (e.g., structure, then content, then polish), resulting in progressive excellence.</dd>

<dt><strong>Kingdom Technology</strong></dt>
<dd>The application of biblical wisdom and Creator-honoring excellence to technical work. Not forced spiritualization, but holistic integration where technical precision and eternal perspective inform each other, producing work that serves practically while maintaining God-centered values.</dd>

<dt><strong>Foundation Discovery</strong></dt>
<dd>Phase 1 of documentation methodology - systematically identifying purpose, audience, requirements, and success criteria before writing. Answers "Why are we documenting this?" and "What must readers achieve?"</dd>

<dt><strong>Structure Design</strong></dt>
<dd>Phase 2 of documentation methodology - creating the organizational framework (ladder) that will hold content. Focuses on hierarchy, flow, and navigation architecture before detailed content creation.</dd>

<dt><strong>Progressive Disclosure</strong></dt>
<dd>Documentation pattern using collapsible sections ("details" elements) that allows readers to control depth and complexity. Essential information remains visible while advanced details can be revealed on demand, serving multiple expertise levels simultaneously. See <a href="../../../template-and-reference/reference/markdown-mastery/07-advanced-features.md">Advanced Markdown Features</a> for implementation.</dd>

<dt><strong>Markdown Tiers</strong></dt>
<dd>Impact-based categorization of markdown elements: <strong>Tier-1 (10/10 impact)</strong> includes headers, lists, tables, code blocks, links, and callouts - essential for all documentation. <strong>Tier-2 (8-9/10 impact)</strong> adds collapsible sections, definition lists, Mermaid diagrams - professional quality enhancements. <strong>Tier-3 (6-7/10 impact)</strong> provides specialized elements for specific use cases. See <a href="../../../template-and-reference/reference/markdown-mastery/08-impact-ratings-introduction.md">Impact Ratings Introduction</a> for complete framework.</dd>

<dt><strong>Timeline-Validated Pattern</strong></dt>
<dd>Documentation practices proven effective across multiple projects/quarters of real development. Validated patterns meet three criteria: (1) used consistently across projects, (2) measurably improved quality or developer experience, (3) survived evolution without being abandoned. See <a href="../10-timeline-validated-patterns.md">Timeline-Validated Patterns</a> for complete pattern library.</dd>

<dt><strong>Documentation-First Development</strong></dt>
<dd>Creating format standards and templates BEFORE creating content. Prevents inconsistency from day one by establishing quality baselines pre-content. Validated in Q2 2025 Assembler project: 8 SDF templates created March 15, implementation began March 23 - resulted in zero inconsistency issues across 47+ documents. See <a href="../10-timeline-validated-patterns.md#pattern-4-documentation-first-development">Pattern 4</a> for implementation steps.</dd>
