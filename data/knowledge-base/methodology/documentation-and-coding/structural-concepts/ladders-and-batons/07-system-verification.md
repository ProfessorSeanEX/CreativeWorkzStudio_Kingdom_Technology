## üîç System Verification - Is Integration Working?

### Integration Health Checklist:

```yaml
System_Health_Verification:
  
  ladder_integrity:
    - [ ] Clear hierarchical levels defined
    - [ ] Direction established (which way is "up")
    - [ ] No circular structural patterns
    - [ ] Each level builds ONLY on levels below
  
  baton_flow:
    - [ ] Clear understanding/dependency tracked at each level
    - [ ] Handoffs between levels explicit
    - [ ] No logic gaps (dropped batons)
    - [ ] Progressive accumulation visible
    - [ ] Baton respects ladder direction (up/down only)
  
  spiral_quality:
    - [ ] Revisiting happens at NEW depths, not same level
    - [ ] Each revisit adds genuine understanding
    - [ ] Spirals justified by accumulated context
    - [ ] Vertical component present (not just circular)
    - [ ] Spirals respect ladder structure
  
  integration_quality:
    - [ ] Structure (Ladder) + Content (Baton) + Depth (Spiral) all present
    - [ ] Three concepts working harmoniously
    - [ ] No conflicts between concepts
    - [ ] System enables clarity AND complexity
    - [ ] No circular dependencies anywhere
