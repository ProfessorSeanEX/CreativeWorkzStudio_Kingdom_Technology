## âš¡ The Integration Principles

### Core Integration Rules:

```yaml
Integration_Principles:
  
  principle_1_structure_first:
    rule: Establish ladder structure before flowing content
    reason: Content needs pathways to travel
    application: Define layers/sections/hierarchy THEN determine flow
  
  principle_2_baton_follows_ladder:
    rule: Baton ONLY moves up/down ladder, never violates structure
    reason: Content respects structural constraints
    application: Dependencies/understanding flow within ladder rules
  
  principle_3_spiral_respects_both:
    rule: Spirals maintain ladder direction AND baton progression
    reason: Depth doesn't break linear integrity
    application: Revisit concepts at NEW rungs with MORE baton content
  
  principle_4_parallel_separation:
    rule: Multiple ladders possible, each with own baton, no cross-flow
    reason: Separation of concerns maintained
    application: Technical track separate from conceptual track
  
  principle_5_no_circles:
    rule: NEVER return to same rung with same understanding
    reason: Circular dependencies break everything
    application: If revisiting, must be spiral (new level) not circle (same level)
```
