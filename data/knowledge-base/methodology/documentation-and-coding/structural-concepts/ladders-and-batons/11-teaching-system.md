## ðŸ”„ Teaching This System to Others

### How to Introduce the Concepts:

```yaml
Teaching_Sequence:
  
  stage_1_ladder:
    introduce: "What's difference between ladder and wheel?"
    realization: Linear vs circular, up/down vs around
    concept: Structure that prevents circles
  
  stage_2_baton:
    introduce: "What is a baton?"
    realization: What gets passed in relay
    concept: Content that moves through structure
  
  stage_3_integration:
    introduce: "How do ladder and baton work together?"
    realization: Structure provides path, content travels it
    concept: Combined system
  
  stage_4_parallel:
    introduce: "Batons move in parallel, but always up or down"
    realization: Multiple tracks possible, no cross-flow
    concept: Separation of concerns
  
  stage_5_spiral:
    introduce: "We can make spirals, what does that mean?"
    realization: Around AND up/down = revisit at new depth
    concept: Iterative deepening
  
  stage_6_synthesis:
    introduce: "Now put all three together"
    realization: Complete information architecture system
    concept: Ladder + Baton + Spiral = Full pattern
```

**Socratic Method**: Questions lead to self-discovery of principles.
