## ðŸ“‹ Integration Teaching Synthesis

**How the concepts were taught together**:

### Phase 1: Ladder vs Wheel
- **Question**: "What's the difference between a ladder and a wheel?"
- **Realization**: Ladder = linear (up/down), Wheel = circular (loops)
- **Insight**: Ladder structure prevents circular dependencies

### Phase 2: The Baton
- **Question**: "What is a baton?"
- **Realization**: What gets PASSED in relay race = understanding in documentation
- **Insight**: Baton is CONTENT moving through structure

### Phase 3: Parallel Batons
- **Teaching**: "Batons can move in parallel, but a baton always passes up or down, no matter what"
- **Realization**: Multiple tracks possible, but no sideways exchanges
- **Insight**: Separation of concerns maintained across parallel ladders

### Phase 4: Spirals
- **Context**: "Abstract concepts don't always move linearly..."
- **Question**: "We can make spirals, what does that mean"
- **Realization**: Spiral = circular + vertical (revisit at NEW depth, not same level)
- **Insight**: Can deepen iteratively while maintaining linear progression

### Phase 5: Synthesis Request
- **Request**: "Now synthesize all three concepts together"
- **Integration**: Understanding how ladder/baton/spiral form complete system
- **Result**: This document!
