## ðŸ“š Using This System

### When Designing Documentation:
1. **Map the ladder**: What's the chapter/section hierarchy?
2. **Track the baton**: What understanding passes section to section?
3. **Plan the spirals**: Which concepts need revisiting at deeper levels?
4. **Verify no circles**: Check no section depends on later sections
5. **Test flow**: Can reader follow without getting lost?

### When Building Code:
1. **Establish layers**: What's the dependency hierarchy (ladder)?
2. **Define interfaces**: What gets passed between layers (baton)?
3. **Plan iterations**: Which modules will evolve through layers (spiral)?
4. **Check dependencies**: Verify no circular imports
5. **Test compilation**: Does dependency graph flow cleanly?

### When Designing Systems:
1. **Define tiers**: What's the architectural layering (ladder)?
2. **Map data flow**: How does information move (baton)?
3. **Identify cross-cutting concerns**: What appears at multiple tiers (spiral candidates)?
4. **Verify boundaries**: Check no tier depends on tiers above it
5. **Test maintainability**: Can system evolve without breaking?

### When Teaching/Learning:
1. **Outline curriculum**: What's the learning progression (ladder)?
2. **Track prerequisite knowledge**: What understanding builds on what (baton)?
3. **Identify key concepts for depth**: What needs multiple passes (spiral)?
4. **Check learning gaps**: Verify no concept used before taught
5. **Test comprehension**: Can learner follow progression?
