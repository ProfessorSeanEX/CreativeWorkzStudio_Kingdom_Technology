## ðŸ§  Core Integration Understanding

### The Three Concepts in Relationship:

```yaml
System_Components:
  
  ladder_provides:
    element: Structure
    function: Defines possible pathways
    constraint: Up or down only, no circles
    enables: Directional framework
    metaphor: The staircase itself
  
  baton_provides:
    element: Content
    function: What travels the pathways
    constraint: Follows ladder rules (up/down)
    enables: Progressive understanding
    metaphor: What the runner carries
  
  spiral_provides:
    element: Enrichment
    function: Depth through controlled revisiting
    constraint: Respects ladder direction (always new level)
    enables: Iterative deepening
    metaphor: The climbing path that circles upward
  
  together:
    result: Complete information architecture
    capability: Linear + Progressive + Deep without circular dependencies
```
