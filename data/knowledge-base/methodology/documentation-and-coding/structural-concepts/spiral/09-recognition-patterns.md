## ðŸ“ˆ Spiral Recognition Patterns

### Healthy Spiral Signs:

```yaml
Healthy_Spiral_Indicators:
  progressive_depth:
    - Each revisit reveals new layer of understanding
    - Context accumulates, enriching perspective
    - "Aha! NOW I really understand X" moments
  
  maintained_direction:
    - Still ascending/descending through structure
    - No circular dependency loops
    - Linear flow preserved
  
  justified_revisiting:
    - Revisits happen BECAUSE new context makes them meaningful
    - Not arbitrary or forced
    - Each revisit earns its place
```

### Broken Spiral Signs:

```yaml
Broken_Spiral_Indicators:
  circular_not_spiral:
    - Returns to same understanding level
    - No new depth added
    - Feels repetitive, not enriching
  
  lost_direction:
    - Unclear if progressing or just circling
    - Ladder structure abandoned
    - Readers/users feel lost
  
  forced_revisiting:
    - Revisits without sufficient new context
    - Arbitrary returns to concepts
    - Doesn't add genuine value
```
