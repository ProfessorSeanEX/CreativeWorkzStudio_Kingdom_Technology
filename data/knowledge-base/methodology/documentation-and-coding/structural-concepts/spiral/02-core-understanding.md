### What Is The Spiral?

**The spiral is DEEPENING** - the mechanism for revisiting concepts at progressively richer levels.

```yaml
Spiral Definition:
  concept: Controlled revisiting with accumulated context
  movement: Around AND up/down (respects ladder directionality)
  constraint: Never returns to SAME depth, always NEW level
  purpose: Enable iterative deepening without creating circles
  applies_to: [concept_refinement, iterative_learning, layered_understanding, progressive_complexity]
```

**Key Insight**: A spiral is NOT a circle. Circles return to the same point at the same level. Spirals return to similar territory but at DIFFERENT altitude (understanding level).
