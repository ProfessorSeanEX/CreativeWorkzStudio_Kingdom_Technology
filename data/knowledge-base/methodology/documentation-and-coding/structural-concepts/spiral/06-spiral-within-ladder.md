## ⚡ Spiral Within Ladder Framework

**Critical Integration**: Spirals RESPECT the up/down baton rule.

```yaml
Spiral_Ladder_Integration:
  ladder_provides: Linear structure (up/down direction)
  spiral_enables: Revisiting within that structure
  key_constraint: Spiral ALWAYS ascends/descends (never same level)
  result: Can deepen concepts while maintaining linear flow
  
  formula: "Spiral = Ladder (direction) + Revisiting (depth)"
```

### How Spirals Work WITH Ladders:

```yaml
Integration_Pattern:
  ladder_movement:
    - Section 1 (Rung 1)
    - Section 2 (Rung 2)  
    - Section 3 (Rung 3)
    - Section 4 (Rung 4)
  
  spiral_enrichment:
    - Section 1: Introduce Concept A (Level 1)
    - Section 2: New Concept B (Level 1)
    - Section 3: Revisit A at Level 2 (with B context)
    - Section 4: Revisit A at Level 3 (with B+C context)
  
  combined_result:
    - Linear progression maintained (Ladder)
    - Concept A deepened through revisiting (Spiral)
    - No circular logic (different depths each time)
    - Understanding accumulates progressively
```

**Visual**:
```
Rung 1: [A₁] ← Concept A at basic level
    ↓
Rung 2: [B₁] ← Concept B introduced
    ↓
Rung 3: [A₂] ← Concept A revisited with B context (DEEPER)
    ↓  
Rung 4: [C₁] ← Concept C introduced
    ↓
Rung 5: [A₃] ← Concept A revisited with B+C context (EVEN DEEPER)
```

Still climbing the ladder (linear), but enriching A along the way (spiral).
