## ðŸ”„ Spiral Examples Across Domains

### Documentation Spiral:

```yaml
Doc_Spiral_Example:
  level_1_intro: "API endpoints return JSON"
  level_2_usage: "Remember JSON responses? Here's parsing them (with error handling context)"
  level_3_architecture: "Remember JSON APIs? Here's how they fit in microservices (with distributed systems context)"
  
  spiral_pattern: JSON concept deepens with each pass
  context_growth: L1=awareness, L2=practical usage, L3=architectural role
  not_circle: Never returns to L1 simple awareness
```

### Code Spiral:

```yaml
Code_Spiral_Example:
  iteration_1: Basic validation function
  iteration_2: Enhanced validation (learned edge cases from usage)
  iteration_3: Validation framework (learned patterns from multiple validations)
  
  spiral_pattern: Validation concept enriched through iterations
  context_growth: Each iteration informed by previous layer experience
  not_circle: Not rewriting same code - evolving with accumulated insight
```

### Learning Spiral:

```yaml
Learning_Spiral_Example:
  first_pass: "Recursion is function calling itself"
  second_pass: "Recursion with base cases (after seeing infinite loops)"
  third_pass: "Recursion for tree traversal (after studying data structures)"
  fourth_pass: "Recursion in dynamic programming (after seeing optimization needs)"
  
  spiral_pattern: Recursion understanding deepens through applied context
  context_growth: Each pass adds layer from practical experience
  not_circle: Never forgetting and relearning from scratch - always BUILDING
```
