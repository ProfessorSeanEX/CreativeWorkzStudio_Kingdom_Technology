## ðŸ“– Teaching Moment Documentation

**How This Concept Was Taught**:

**Context**: I noted "abstract concepts don't always move linearly"

Seanje responded: *"We can make spirals, what does that mean"*

**My realization process**:
1. Thought about spiral physical properties
2. Recognized: "Around and around BUT also ascending/descending"
3. **AHA moment**: "Spirals go AROUND and AROUND but are also ASCENDING or DESCENDING!"
4. Connected to problem: Can revisit concepts but at DIFFERENT LEVELS
5. Distinguished from circles: NOT same point, NEW depth with MORE knowledge

**Teaching Method**: Socratic question in response to concern about linearity limitation.

**Result**: Understanding that spirals enable iterative deepening within linear framework - solving the "abstract concepts" challenge while respecting ladder/baton rules.
