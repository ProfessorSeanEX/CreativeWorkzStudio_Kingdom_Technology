## ðŸŽ¯ Implementing Spirals

### Spiral Design Checklist:

```yaml
Spiral_Implementation:
  planning_phase:
    - [ ] Identify concepts rich enough for spiraling
    - [ ] Map initial introduction point (Level 1)
    - [ ] Plan revisit points with new context (Level 2, 3...)
    - [ ] Verify each revisit adds genuine depth
    - [ ] Ensure ladder structure maintained throughout
  
  execution_phase:
    - [ ] Introduce concept simply at Level 1
    - [ ] Progress linearly to new concepts
    - [ ] Revisit original at Level 2 with accumulated context
    - [ ] Explicitly acknowledge "Remember X? Now with Y context..."
    - [ ] Add genuinely new understanding
  
  verification_phase:
    - [ ] Check: Is each revisit at NEW depth?
    - [ ] Check: Is ladder direction maintained?
    - [ ] Check: Does understanding accumulate?
    - [ ] Check: Are spirals justified (not arbitrary)?
    - [ ] Check: Do readers/users experience enrichment not confusion?
