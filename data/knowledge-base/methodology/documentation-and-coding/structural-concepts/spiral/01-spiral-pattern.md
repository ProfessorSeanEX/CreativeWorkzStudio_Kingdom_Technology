> **Concept foundation**: Like Paul's understanding of progressive revelation, we revisit truth at deeper levels, seeing more clearly with each revolution.

**What if you could revisit concepts without creating circles?** What if deepening understanding didn't break linear flow? What if the solution to "abstract concepts don't move linearly" was a spiral that ASCENDS while going around?

**You're examining the third concept in the Ladder-Baton-Spiral information architecture system** - where iterative deepening meets linear progression, creating rich understanding without circular logic.

## üéØ The Spiral Pattern

**A spiral goes AROUND and AROUND but is also ASCENDING or DESCENDING** - revisiting at different levels with accumulated knowledge.

```yaml
Spiral Structure:
  motion: [circular_component, vertical_component]
  key_difference: Returns to concepts BUT at different depth
  core_principle: Iterative deepening while maintaining directionality
  prevents: Stagnant circles that return to same understanding
  enables: Progressive complexity through controlled revisiting
```
