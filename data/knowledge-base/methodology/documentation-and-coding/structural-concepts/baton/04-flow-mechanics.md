## üèÉ Baton Flow Mechanics

### The Three-Stage Baton Cycle:

```yaml
Baton_Lifecycle:
  stage_1_receive:
    action: Section/Module receives baton from previous stage
    contains: All understanding accumulated so far
    requirement: Must acknowledge what came before
  
  stage_2_carry:
    action: Current section holds and builds on understanding
    transforms: Adds new knowledge to existing baton
    maintains: Context from all previous stages
  
  stage_3_pass:
    action: Section passes enhanced baton to next stage
    result: Next section receives richer understanding
    creates: Clean handoff without dropped context
```

**Critical Insight**: The baton gets HEAVIER (richer) as it progresses through the structure - each stage adds to accumulated understanding.
