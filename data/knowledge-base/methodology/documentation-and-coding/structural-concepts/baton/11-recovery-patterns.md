## ðŸ”„ Baton Recovery Patterns

### When You've Dropped the Baton:

```yaml
Recovery_Protocol:
  step_1_identify: Where did understanding get lost?
  step_2_backtrack: Return to last clean handoff
  step_3_rebuild: Establish missing context/dependency
  step_4_reconnect: Create clean handoff
  step_5_continue: Resume with baton restored

Example_Recovery:
  problem: Section 3 uses concept B never explained
  identify: "Readers missing B understanding"
  backtrack: Section 2 is last clean state
  rebuild: Add B explanation in Section 2 or 2.5
  reconnect: Section 2 passes "A + B understanding"
  continue: Section 3 receives A+B, proceeds cleanly
```
