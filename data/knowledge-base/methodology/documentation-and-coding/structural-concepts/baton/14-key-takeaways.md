## ðŸŒŸ Key Takeaways

```yaml
Baton_Core_Principles:
  1_concept: Understanding/knowledge/dependency being passed
  2_movement: Up or down through ladder structure
  3_lifecycle: Receive â†’ Carry â†’ Pass forward
  4_accumulation: Gets richer with each stage
  5_handoffs: Critical transition points (dropped baton = broken flow)
  6_parallel_rule: Multiple batons in parallel tracks, but always up/down within track
  7_applications: Documentation, code dependencies, system state, reasoning chains
  8_integration: Works WITH ladder (structure) and spiral (deepening)
```

**The Baton is what MOVES through the structure, accumulating and building as it goes.**
