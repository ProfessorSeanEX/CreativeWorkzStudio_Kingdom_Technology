## ðŸ“ˆ Recognizing Baton Patterns

### Baton Present and Healthy:

```yaml
Healthy_Baton_Signs:
  documentation:
    - Reader never confused about what they should know
    - Each section builds naturally on previous
    - Transitions acknowledge what came before
    - No sudden unexplained concepts
  
  code:
    - All imports defined before use
    - Dependencies available when needed
    - Compilation succeeds without circular errors
    - Module boundaries clear
  
  thinking:
    - Logical flow maintained
    - Each conclusion follows from previous reasoning
    - No logical leaps without justification
    - Argument chain unbroken
```

### Baton Dropped:

```yaml
Dropped_Baton_Signs:
  documentation:
    - "Wait, what is X?" (undefined term used)
    - Logic gaps between sections
    - Reader must jump backward for context
    - Concepts appear without foundation
  
  code:
    - Circular import errors
    - Undefined reference errors  
    - Module using functionality not yet available
    - Dependency resolution failures
  
  thinking:
    - "How did we get here?" (logical leap)
    - Premises forgotten mid-argument
    - Conclusions not supported by reasoning
    - Context lost between points
```
