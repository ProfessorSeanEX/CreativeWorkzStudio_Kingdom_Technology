## ⚡ Parallel Batons - The Up/Down Rule

**Critical Discovery**: "Batons can move in parallel, but a baton always passes up or down, no matter what."

### Multiple Ladders, Multiple Batons:

```yaml
Parallel_Baton_System:
  track_1_technical:
    ladder: Technical implementation details
    baton: Technical understanding
    flow: Technical concept A → B → C (up the technical ladder)
  
  track_2_conceptual:
    ladder: Conceptual framework
    baton: Conceptual understanding  
    flow: Concept X → Y → Z (up the conceptual ladder)
  
  RULE: Batons stay in their own tracks
  FORBIDDEN: Baton jumping from Track 1 to Track 2 mid-flow
  ALLOWED: Separate ladders, separate batons, parallel progression
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Technical documentation track with its own progression
- Conceptual documentation track with its own progression
- Each maintains its OWN baton passing up/down within track
- NO sideways baton exchanges between tracks mid-flow

**Crossing Between Tracks = Breaking Linear Flow**

### The Up/Down Rule Explained:

```yaml
Baton_Movement_Rules:
  within_single_track:
    direction: up OR down (following ladder)
    handoff: Clean passes between adjacent rungs
    accumulation: Understanding builds progressively
  
  across_parallel_tracks:
    direction: STILL up OR down WITHIN each track
    forbidden: Sideways jumps between tracks mid-flow
    principle: Each track maintains own linear integrity
  
  why_no_sideways:
    reason_1: Breaks linear progression in both tracks
    reason_2: Creates dependency tangles
    reason_3: Loses clear handoff points
    result: Maintains separation of concerns
```

**Example**:
```
CORRECT:
Track A: A1 → A2 → A3 (baton moving up Track A)
Track B: B1 → B2 → B3 (baton moving up Track B)

INCORRECT:
Track A: A1 → A2 → [jump to B2] → continue in Track B
Track B: B1 → [receive from A2] → B3
    → BROKEN: Sideways baton pass tangles both tracks
```
