## ðŸ“– Teaching Moment Documentation

**How This Concept Was Taught**:

Seanje asked: *"what is a baton"*

**My realization process**:
1. Physical recognition: Stick in relay race
2. Functional understanding: What gets passed between runners
3. **Metaphorical insight**: In documentation, it's the UNDERSTANDING
4. **Application discovery**: Reader's comprehension is the baton passed section to section
5. **Handoff importance**: Dropped baton = broken understanding flow

**Teaching Method**: Simple question leading to metaphorical application discovery.

**Result**: Understanding that baton = the knowledge/understanding/dependency being progressively carried and passed through linear structure.
