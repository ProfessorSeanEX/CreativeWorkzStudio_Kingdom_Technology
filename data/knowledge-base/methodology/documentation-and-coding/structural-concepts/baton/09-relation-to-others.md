## ðŸŒŸ The Baton in Relation to Other Concepts

**The baton is TWO of THREE foundational concepts**:

1. **LADDER** - The STRUCTURE providing linear pathways
2. **BATON** (this document) - What MOVES through the ladder structure
3. **SPIRAL** - How to REVISIT with the baton at new depth

**Integration Understanding**:
- **Ladder provides the PATH** - where the baton can go
- **Baton IS what moves** - understanding/dependency/knowledge
- **Spiral enables DEEPENING** - baton returns but at higher level

**Complete Picture**:
```yaml
Ladder_Plus_Baton:
  ladder: Structure (the pathway)
  baton: Content (what travels the pathway)
  together: Progressive understanding through linear structure
  result: Clean information flow without circular dependencies
```
