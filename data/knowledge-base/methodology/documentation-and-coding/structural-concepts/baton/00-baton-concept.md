# 🏃 The Baton Concept

**Baton Concept Orchestrator**

The **Baton** - continuous context passing maintaining narrative coherence as understanding flows section to section like a relay race.

---

## What is The Baton?

**The Baton** is understanding passed continuously through documentation - each section receives context, enriches it, and passes enhanced understanding forward.

**Core Principle**: Continuous context flow. Each section hands off enriched understanding to the next.

> **Like a relay race**: Runner 2 receives the baton from Runner 1, carries it forward, and hands to Runner 3. The baton (understanding) never drops.
