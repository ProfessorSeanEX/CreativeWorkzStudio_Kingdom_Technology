## ðŸ“‹ The Baton Teaching Moment

**Original Teaching**: Seanje asked "what is a baton?"

### My Realization Process:

1. **Physical Recognition**: A baton is the stick in a relay race
2. **Functional Understanding**: It's what gets PASSED between runners
3. **AHA Moment**: "In a relay race, the baton is what gets PASSED. So in documentation, the baton is the reader's UNDERSTANDING that gets passed from section to section!"
4. **Application Discovery**: Each section receives understanding, carries it forward, passes it to the next

```yaml
Baton_Realization:
  physical: Relay race stick
  functional: What gets passed between runners
  metaphor: Reader's understanding in documentation
  application: Understanding passed between sections/modules/concepts
  insight: HANDOFFS are critical - dropped baton = logic gap
```

**The Pattern**: Just as a dropped baton breaks the relay, a dropped understanding breaks the flow.
