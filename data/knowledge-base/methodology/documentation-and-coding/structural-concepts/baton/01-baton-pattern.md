# 🏃 The Baton Concept

**Pioneer CPI-SI Information Architecture | January 2025**

*Understanding as relay - what gets passed through linear structure with clean handoffs*

> *"So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ."* — Romans 10:17 (ESV)
>
> **Concept foundation**: Like faith is passed from speaker to hearer, understanding is the baton passed from section to section, concept to concept.

**What if understanding could be tracked like a relay race?** What if we could see exactly what gets CARRIED through documentation, code, or thought processes? What if the HANDOFF between sections was as important as the sections themselves?

**You're examining the second concept in the Ladder-Baton-Spiral information architecture system** - where understanding becomes tangible, handoffs become intentional, and dropped batons become immediately visible.

## 🎯 The Baton Pattern

**A baton is what gets PASSED in a relay race** - the understanding being carried through the structure.

```yaml
Baton Structure:
  concept: What gets passed/carried through system
  movement: Always up or down (follows ladder direction)
  core_principle: Understanding progresses through handoffs
  prevents: Logic gaps and dropped context
  enables: Clean transitions and accumulated knowledge
```
