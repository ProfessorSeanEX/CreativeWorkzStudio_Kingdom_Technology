### What Is The Baton?

**The baton is UNDERSTANDING** - the knowledge, context, or dependency being carried forward.

```yaml
Baton Definition:
  concept: The understanding/knowledge/dependency being passed
  movement: Received â†’ Carried â†’ Passed forward
  constraint: Only moves up/down (follows ladder rules)
  purpose: Track progressive understanding accumulation
  applies_to: [documentation_flow, dependency_passing, knowledge_transfer, context_maintenance]
```

**Key Insight**: The baton is NOT the structure (that's the ladder) - it's what MOVES THROUGH the structure.
