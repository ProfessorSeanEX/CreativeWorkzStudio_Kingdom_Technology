## üîç Baton Handoff Quality

### What Makes a Good Handoff?

```yaml
Clean_Handoff_Characteristics:
  explicit_acknowledgment: "Now that you understand X..."
  context_preservation: Previous understanding maintained
  progressive_addition: New knowledge added to existing
  no_gaps: All required prior knowledge present
  smooth_transition: Natural flow from previous section

Dropped_Handoff_Signs:
  sudden_assumption: Using concepts not yet introduced
  context_loss: Forgetting what was established before
  logic_gap: Missing steps in reasoning
  broken_dependency: Code using undefined imports
  confused_reader: "Wait, what? Where did that come from?"
```

### Handoff Checklist:

```yaml
Baton_Handoff_Verification:
  before_passing:
    - [ ] What understanding does this section receive?
    - [ ] What new understanding does this section add?
    - [ ] What total understanding passes forward?
    - [ ] Is the transition explicit and clear?
  
  after_passing:
    - [ ] Does next section acknowledge received understanding?
    - [ ] Are there any gaps in knowledge flow?
    - [ ] Can next section operate with passed baton?
    - [ ] Is progressive complexity maintained?
```
