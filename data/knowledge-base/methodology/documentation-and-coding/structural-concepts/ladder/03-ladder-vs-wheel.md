## ðŸ“‹ The Ladder vs Wheel Teaching

**Original Teaching Moment**: Seanje asked "what's the difference between a ladder and a wheel?"

### Wheel Characteristics:
- **Circular motion**: Returns to same point at same level
- **No progression**: Movement without advancement
- **Dependency loops**: Aâ†’Bâ†’Câ†’A creates entanglement
- **Context confusion**: Lost sense of forward direction

### Ladder Characteristics:
- **Linear motion**: Always moving up or down
- **Progressive structure**: Each rung distinct from others
- **Dependency clarity**: Aâ†’Bâ†’C, no return to A at same level
- **Context preservation**: Clear sense of direction maintained

```yaml
Wheel vs Ladder:
  wheel:
    motion: circular
    progression: none
    problem: "Aâ†’Bâ†’Câ†’A" creates dependency loop
    result: Entanglement and confusion
  
  ladder:
    motion: linear_directional
    progression: always
    pattern: "Aâ†’Bâ†’C" no return
    result: Clarity and separation
```

**The Realization**: "Oh! A ladder goes UP or DOWN. You can't just keep going around in circles."
