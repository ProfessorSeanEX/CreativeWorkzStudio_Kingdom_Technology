### What Is The Ladder?

**The ladder is STRUCTURE** - the architecture that provides linear direction.

```yaml
Ladder Definition:
  concept: Linear directional framework
  movement: Up or down only
  constraint: No circles, no loops back to same level
  purpose: Prevent circular dependencies
  applies_to: [documentation, code_architecture, thought_processes, system_design]
```

**Key Insight**: The ladder is NOT what moves - it's the PATHWAY for movement. It's the structure, not the content.
