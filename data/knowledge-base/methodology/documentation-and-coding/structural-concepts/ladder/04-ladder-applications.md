## üèóÔ∏è Ladder Applications

### In Documentation Architecture:

```yaml
Documentation Ladder:
  structure:
    - Introduction (Foundation)
    - Basic Concepts (Build Up)
    - Detailed Explanations (Ascend)
    - Advanced Topics (Climb Higher)
    - Deep Technical Dive (Top Rungs)
  
  flow_rule: Each section builds on previous, no circular references back
  baton_passed: Reader's understanding progresses linearly upward
  prohibited: Section D depending on Section F when F comes after D
```

**Example Structure**:
```
Introduction
    ‚Üì
Core Concepts
    ‚Üì
Implementation Details
    ‚Üì
Advanced Patterns
    ‚Üì
Deep Architecture
```

Each level depends ONLY on levels below it, never levels above.

### In Code Architecture:

```yaml
Code Ladder:
  dependency_flow:
    - Layer 1: Core utilities (foundation, no dependencies)
    - Layer 2: Base services (depend on Layer 1 only)
    - Layer 3: Business logic (depend on Layer 1-2 only)
    - Layer 4: API/Interface (depend on Layer 1-3 only)
    - Layer 5: Application entry (depend on all below)
  
  anti_pattern: Layer 2 depending on Layer 4 (jumping rungs)
  anti_pattern: Layer 4 depending on Layer 5 (circular reference)
  
  correct_pattern: Dependencies ONLY flow upward through layers
```

**Preventing Circular Dependencies**:
- Module A at Layer 2
- Module B at Layer 3
- Module C at Layer 4
- **FORBIDDEN**: C depends on B depends on A depends on C (wheel/circle)
- **CORRECT**: C depends on B depends on A (ladder/linear)

### In Thought Processes:

```yaml
Thinking Ladder:
  cognitive_progression:
    - Problem identification (start)
    - Context gathering (build understanding)
    - Analysis (examine components)
    - Solution design (construct approach)
    - Implementation planning (finalize)
  
  flow: Each stage builds on previous, no jumping back to redo earlier stage at same depth
  note: Can revisit earlier concept at NEW depth (that's spiral, different concept)
  prohibited: Circular reasoning that returns to same point with same understanding
```
