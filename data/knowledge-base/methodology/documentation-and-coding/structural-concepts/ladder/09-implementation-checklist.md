Ladder_Implementation:
  documentation:
    - [ ] Map all sections to ladder rungs
    - [ ] Verify each section only references previous sections
    - [ ] Check no circular references exist
    - [ ] Ensure progressive complexity upward
  
  code_architecture:
    - [ ] Establish clear dependency layers
    - [ ] Verify imports only reference lower layers
    - [ ] Check no circular imports
    - [ ] Test dependency graph shows linear flow
  
  system_design:
    - [ ] Define module hierarchy
    - [ ] Map all inter-module dependencies
    - [ ] Identify any circular patterns
    - [ ] Refactor circles into linear progression
  
  thought_process:
    - [ ] Outline thinking progression
    - [ ] Check each step builds on previous
