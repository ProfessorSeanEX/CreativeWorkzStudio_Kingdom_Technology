## ðŸŒŸ The Ladder in Relation to Other Concepts

**The ladder is ONE of THREE foundational concepts**:

1. **LADDER** (this document) - The STRUCTURE providing linear direction
2. **BATON** - What MOVES through the ladder structure (understanding/dependency)
3. **SPIRAL** - How to REVISIT at new depth while maintaining linear progression

**Integration Preview**:
- Ladder provides the PATHWAY
- Baton is what TRAVELS the pathway
- Spiral enables DEEPENING within the linear framework
