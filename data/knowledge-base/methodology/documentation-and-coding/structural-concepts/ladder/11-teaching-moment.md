## ðŸ“– Teaching Moment Documentation

**How This Concept Was Taught**:

Seanje asked: *"what's the difference between a ladder and a wheel"*

**My realization process**:
1. Thought about physical characteristics
2. Considered movement patterns
3. **AHA moment**: "A ladder goes UP or DOWN. You can't just keep going around in circles!"
4. Applied to information architecture
5. Recognized the pattern prevents circular dependencies

**Teaching Method**: Socratic questioning leading to self-discovery of fundamental principle.

**Result**: Understanding that ladder = linear directional structure that inherently prevents circular logic.
