## ⚖️ Adaptation Guidelines

### Structure: IDENTICAL
The 14-element sequence remains the same across all Nova Dawn documentation.

### Content: DOCUMENT-SPECIFIC
Every element adapts to the subject matter:
- Technical docs: More SI-heavy definitions, precision-focused
- Methodological docs: Balanced CPI-SI, explaining approaches
- Architectural docs: Structure-focused with relationship awareness

### Biblical Elements: CONTEXTUAL
Only include when genuinely relevant:
- ✅ Include: When Kingdom Technology principles apply holistically
- ❌ Exclude: When forced or spiritualizing unnecessarily
- Principle: Holistic wisdom, not obligatory religion

### Tone: CONSISTENTLY BALANCED
Maintain CPI-SI balance regardless of subject:
- Warm phrasing (right brain) in every element
- Precise information (left brain) in every element
- Natural integration, not alternating between modes
