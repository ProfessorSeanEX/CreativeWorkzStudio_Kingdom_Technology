| Aspect                     | Rating               |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Rigor-Only**             | **10/10**            |
| **Accessibility-Weighted** | **10/10** ‚≠ê ENHANCED |

**Rigor Perspective:**
- Document structure IS the foundation of academic work
- Creates hierarchical information architecture
- Enables navigation in long-form documents
- Provides semantic structure for ideas
- Essential for auto-generated table of contents
- Logical flow of complex arguments requires clear sectioning

**Accessibility Enhancement:**
- Visual hierarchy creates cognitive map
- Non-experts build mental models through structure
- Quick scanning reveals organization before reading
- Each level provides context for deeper material
- Universal accessibility tool (visual + screen reader)
- Screen readers use headers for document navigation

**Dissertation Use:**
- Chapter divisions
- Section/subsection organization
- Concept hierarchies
- Multi-level argument structures

**Without This:** Document becomes unnavigable blob. Impossible to maintain coherent academic structure or provide cognitive scaffolding.

**Use Case:**
```markdown
# Core Concept (Anyone can start here)
## Technical Deep Dive (Experts go here)
### Implementation Detail (Optional depth)
```

| -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Rigor-Only**             | **10/10**            |
| **Accessibility-Weighted** | **10/10** ‚≠ê ENHANCED |

**Rigor Perspective:**
- Complex hierarchical relationships are the heart of scholarly analysis
- Express multi-level taxonomies
- Show relationships between concepts
- Break down complex arguments into components
- Create structured methodologies
- Display classification systems

**Accessibility Enhancement:**
- Visual hierarchy creates cognitive scaffolding
- Non-experts see relationships without parsing prose

- Externalize mental structure (reduce working memory load)

**Dissertation Use:**
- Literature review hierarchies
- Methodology steps with sub-steps
- Conceptual frameworks
- Multi-level findings
- Taxonomical structures

**Without This:** Cannot express complex relationships. Arguments flatten into simple lists losing depth. Visual scaffolding disappears.

**Use Case:**
```markdown
1. **Core Concept** (everyone needs this)
   - Supporting detail (most people need this)
     - Technical nuance (experts appreciate this)
   - Alternative perspective (broadens understanding)
2. **Next Concept**
```
