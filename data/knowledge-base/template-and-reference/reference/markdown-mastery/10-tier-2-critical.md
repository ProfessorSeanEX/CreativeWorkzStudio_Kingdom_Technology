| -------------------------- | -------- |
| **Rigor-Only**             | **9/10** |
| **Accessibility-Weighted** | **9/10** |

**Rigor Perspective:**
- Clean citations without cluttering academic prose
- Keep main text readable
- Reuse common references
- Professional citation style
- Separate content from references
- Academic convention alignment

**Accessibility Enhancement:**
- Main text remains readable
- Links grouped at end = better scanning
- Descriptive names > raw URLs
- Separates content from citations

**Dissertation Use:**
- Academic citations
- Repeated references to sources
- Bibliography integration
- Cross-document references

**Deduction:** Can use inline links, but reference-style is cleaner for academic work. Not absolutely essential but significantly better.

### Ordered Lists

| Aspect                     | Rating   |
| -------------------------- | -------- |
| **Rigor-Only**             | **9/10** |
| **Accessibility-Weighted** | **9/10** |

**Rigor Perspective:**
- Sequential processes and hierarchical structures are fundamental to academic methodology
- Present research methodologies
- Show procedural steps
- Create algorithmic descriptions
- Express temporal sequences
- Numbered arguments/findings

**Accessibility Enhancement:**
- Automatic numbering aids comprehension
- Sequential logic made explicit
- Process visualization

**Dissertation Use:**
- Research procedures
- Step-by-step methodologies
- Enumerated findings
- Process descriptions
- Sequential arguments

**Deduction:** Could theoretically use only unordered lists with manual numbering, but ordered lists provide semantic meaning and automatic numbering.

| -------------------------- | -------- |
| **Rigor-Only**             | **9/10** |
| **Accessibility-Weighted** | **9/10** |

**Rigor Perspective:**
- Organizing related concepts without hierarchy is constant in academic writing
- Group related ideas
- Present features/characteristics
- List considerations
- Show alternatives
- Organize non-sequential items

**Accessibility Enhancement:**
- Bullet points = instant pattern recognition
- Non-hierarchical relationships clear
- Visual scanning efficiency

**Dissertation Use:**
- Feature lists
- Consideration sets
- Alternative approaches
- Research questions
- Findings summaries

**Deduction:** Essential, but slightly less critical than nested lists which add dimensional complexity.

### Anchors / Internal Links / TOC

| Aspect                     | Rating              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Rigor-Only**             | **7/10**            |
| **Accessibility-Weighted** | **9/10** ‚≠ê UPGRADED |

**Rigor Perspective:**
- Internal document navigation important for long-form academic work
- Link between sections
- Create table of contents
- Reference earlier content
- Guide reader navigation
- Improve usability

**Accessibility Enhancement ‚Äî NAVIGATION = DEMOCRATIZATION:**
- **Navigation freedom = accessible learning**
- Non-linear reading paths support different learning strategies
- Table of contents = mental model building
- Experts can skip, learners can loop back
- Quick reference enables efficient expert use
- Mental model building at own pace
- Freedom of movement reduces intimidation

**Why Upgraded:**
- **Before:** Rated 7/10 for "internal navigation"
- **After:** 9/10 because navigation IS accessibility
- Not just convenience ‚Äî enabling learning choice
- Different reading styles supported

**Dissertation Use:**
- TOC generation
- "See Section X" references
- Internal citations
- Document navigation

**Deduction (Rigor-Only):** Essential for long documents, but headers provide structure. Anchors enhance navigation rather than enabling structure.

**Use Case:**
```markdown
## Quick Navigation
- [For Beginners](#introduction)
- [For Advanced Users](#technical-details)
- [Reference](#appendix)
```

**Rating Change:** 7/10 ‚Üí **9/10** (accessibility transforms value)

### Images / Diagrams

| Aspect                     | Rating              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Rigor-Only**             | **7/10**            |
| **Accessibility-Weighted** | **9/10** ‚≠ê UPGRADED |

**Rigor Perspective:**
- Visual communication of complex concepts, but markdown has limitations
- Display diagrams
- Show figures
- Present screenshots
- Visualize concepts
- Support explanations

**Accessibility Enhancement ‚Äî MULTI-MODAL LEARNING:**
- **Visual learning IS accessibility**
- Not everyone thinks in text
- Diagrams convey structure faster than prose
- Supports neurodivergent learners
- Cultural/language barrier reduction
- Makes abstract concepts visible
- Reduces language barriers (structure is universal)

**Why Upgraded:**
- **Before:** Rated 7/10 for "visual clarification"
- **After:** 9/10 because visual learning = cognitive diversity support
- Not just illustration ‚Äî enabling different learning styles
- Multi-modal approach is inclusive

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- Alt text (screen readers)
- Captions (context)
- High contrast (visual impairment)
- Simple designs (cognitive load)

**Dissertation Use:**
- Architecture diagrams
- Research figures
- Visual models
- Charts/graphs
- Illustrative examples

**Deduction (Rigor-Only):** Critical for visual content, but markdown image syntax is basic. Often need external tools for proper figure management, captions, etc.

**Rating Change:** 7/10 ‚Üí **9/10** (accessibility transforms value)

### Bold Emphasis

| Aspect                     | Rating   |
| -------------------------- | -------- |
| **Rigor-Only**             | **8/10** |
| **Accessibility-Weighted** | **8/10** |

**Rigor Perspective:**
- Highlighting key terms and concepts guides reader through complex material
- Mark key terminology first use
- Emphasize important concepts
- Create visual anchors
- Highlight findings
- Guide reader attention

**Accessibility Enhancement:**
- Visual scanning cues
- Guides focus for skimming readers
- Attention direction for non-experts

**Dissertation Use:**
- Term definitions (first use)
- Key findings
- Important concepts
- Section emphasis
- Headers within tables

**Deduction:** Can convey everything without bold, but significantly improves scannability and comprehension in long documents.

- Clear boundaries aid navigation
- Universal visual signal

**Why Upgraded:**
- **Before:** Rated 6/10 for "visual separation"
- **After:** 8/10 because chunking prevents cognitive overwhelm
- Not just visual ‚Äî cognitive pacing tool
- Helps processing and comprehension

**Dissertation Use:**
- Between major sections
- Chapter separations
- Thematic breaks
- Part divisions

**Deduction (Rigor-Only):** Headers provide structure; horizontal rules add visual clarity but aren't essential for meaning.
