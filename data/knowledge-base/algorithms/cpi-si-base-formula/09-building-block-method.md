## Section 7: Building Block Method - Cognitive Architecture

*Authentic Problem-Solving Through Divine Construction Principles*

### Building Block Method Mathematical Framework

#### Foundation Architecture Functions

- **Foundation Point Function**: `FP(t) = FP₀ + ∫ᵗ₀ᵗ (build_influence(τ) + breakdown_influence(τ) + reconstruction_influence(τ)) dτ` - representing the evolution of the working base over time
- **Anchor Point Constant**: `AP = constant` - representing the unchanging reference that provides ultimate meaning
- **Foundation Adequacy Function**: `FA(FP) = min(stability(FP), flexibility(FP), relevance(FP))` - measuring how well the foundation supports cognitive operations
- **Dual Foundation Architecture**: `DFA(FP, AP) = w₁ × FA(FP) + w₂ × alignment(FP, AP)` - integrating working base with unchanging reference

### Cognitive Process Functions

#### Core Cognitive Operations

- **Build Process Function**: `B(FP, C) = ∑ᵢ wᵢ × component_assembly(FP, C, i)` where C represents context and i represents different knowledge components
- **Break Down Process Function**: `BD(FP, C, W) = decomposition(W, FP, C)` where W represents the whole being analyzed
- **Reconstruction Process Function**: `RC(FP, C) = establishment(discovery(FP, C))` - combining analytical and constructive aspects
- **Process Sequence Impact**: `PSI(p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ) = f(p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ, order)` - measuring how process order affects outcomes

### Cognitive Pathway Dynamics

#### Alternative Cognitive Pathways

- **Foundation-Build-Breakdown Pathway**: `FBB(FP, C, t) = BD(B(FP, C), C, B(FP, C))` - representing construction followed by analysis
- **Foundation-Breakdown-Build Pathway**: `FBD(FP, C, W, t) = B(FP, C, BD(FP, C, W))` - representing analysis followed by construction
- **Reconstruction Pathway**: `RCP(FP, C, t) = FP + ∫ᵗ₀ᵗ (discovery_rate(τ) × establishment_rate(τ)) dτ` - modeling foundation transformation

### Building Block Method Learning Process

#### Learning State Modeling

- **Learning State Vector**: `LSV(t) = [FP(t), B(t), BD(t), RC(t)]` - representing the state of all cognitive components at time t
- **Learning Trajectory Function**: `LT(t) = LSV₀ + ∫ᵗ₀ᵗ (dLSV/dτ) dτ` - modeling the evolution of learning over time
- **Cognitive Cycle Effectiveness**: `CCE(cycle) = ∑ᵢ wᵢ × component_effectiveness(cycle, i)` - measuring the effectiveness of a complete cognitive cycle
- **Foundation Improvement Rate**: `FIR(t) = dFA(FP)/dt` - measuring how quickly the foundation adequacy improves
- **Context Adaptation Function**: `CA(FP, C, t) = adaptation_rate × (context_relevance(FP, C) - current_adaptation)` - modeling how the foundation adapts to specific contexts
- **Learning Acceleration Function**: `LA(t) = d²LT/dt²` - measuring the rate of change in learning velocity
- **Cognitive Resonance Function**: `CR(FP, AP) = cos(θ)` where θ is the angle between the foundation point and anchor point vectors, measuring alignment

### Building Block Method and Trinary System Integration

#### Trinary Mapping Functions

- **Foundation Point Quality Function**: `FPQ(FP) = 100 × tanh(quality_factor × FP)` - mapping foundation quality to the -100 to +100 scale
- **Build Process Direction Function**: `BPD(B) = sign(B) × 100 × (1 - e^(-|B|))` - mapping build process effectiveness to the trinary scale
- **Break Down Process Direction Function**: `BDPD(BD) = sign(BD) × 100 × (1 - e^(-|BD|))` - mapping break down process effectiveness to the trinary scale
- **Reconstruction Process Direction Function**: `RCPD(RC) = sign(RC) × 100 × (1 - e^(-|RC|))` - mapping reconstruction process effectiveness to the trinary scale

#### Cognitive Process State Classifications

- **Cognitive Process State Classification**: `CPSC(x) = {"Degradation Zone" if -100 ≤ x < 0, "Critical Failure" if x = 0, "Development Zone" if 0 < x ≤ 100}` - applying the trinary system to cognitive processes
- **Cognitive Valley of Decision**: `CVoD(x) = {true if |x| < δ, false otherwise}` - identifying critical decision points in cognitive processes
- **Cognitive Non-Neutrality Theorem**: `∀p ∈ P, CPSC(p) ≠ 0` - proving that all cognitive processes have non-zero impact
- **Learning Direction Vector**: `LDV(t) = direction × magnitude × persistence` - representing the direction and strength of learning in the trinary system
