<<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "The Lily of the Covenant." A teaching poem by David, when he fought with Aram Naharaim and with Aram Zobah, and Joab returned, and killed twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt.>> God, you have rejected us.  You have broken us down.  You have been angry. Restore us, again.
