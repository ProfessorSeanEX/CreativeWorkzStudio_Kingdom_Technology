If anyone has captivity, he will go.  If anyone is with the sword, he must be killed.{TR reads "If anyone leads into captivity, into captivity he goes.  If anyone will kill with the sword, he must be killed with a sword."  instead of "If anyone has captivity, he goes away.  If anyone is with the sword, he must be killed."} Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.
