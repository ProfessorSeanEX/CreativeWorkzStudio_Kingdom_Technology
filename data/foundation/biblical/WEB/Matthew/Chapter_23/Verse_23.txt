"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you tithe mint, dill, and cumin,{ cumin is an aromatic seed from Cuminum cyminum, resembling caraway in flavor and appearance. It is used as a spice.} and have left undone the weightier matters of the law:  justice, mercy, and faith. But you ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.
