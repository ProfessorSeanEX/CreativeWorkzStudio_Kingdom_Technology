Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words of his servant.  If it be Yahweh that has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering:  but if it be the children of men, cursed be they before Yahweh: for they have driven me out this day that I shouldn't cling to Yahweh's inheritance, saying, Go, serve other gods.
